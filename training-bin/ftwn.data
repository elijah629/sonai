Inspired by BeautifulSoup. Instead of parsing static HTML and using tags, it fully renders the page and the entire DOM (including JS/CSS & slop) using Playwright. Then, it uses semantics; i.e: avg font size versus larger font sizes, lines, gaps, spacing, hierachy/reading order; etc, to reconstruct the page into a clean JSON/Markdown format.
Currently, the options are either:

- BeautifulSoup; static only, messy.
- Playwright; lower level, manual.

pls rec a better name‰I started developing the desktop programm for receiving the lidar sensor data from my Diy Lidar scanner over serial. I finished the first version frontend. Next I will work on the backend code and the Arduino code for my scanner˚:I've been away from home and coding on a different machine, which is why it‚Äôs been a while since the last devlog. I basically spent 3 days coding in short 1-hour blocks, and it all added up to about 10 hours of work.

Changelog:
 - Added details to the Streaks section of the dashboard.
 - Gave the nav bar a visual overhaul.
 - The nav bar is now responsive (shrinks properly on mobile devices).
 - Added a 'Daily Thoughts' input with auto-save (O.o). In the attachment that part is actually in portuguese cuz I typed it without thinking (but I'll change it later)
 - Securely reconnected streaks data with the backend. As I said in the past dev logs, the first version was built without authentication (I was still learning!), but that is now resolved.
 - Implemented multiple DTOs to ensure correct data transfer.SAdded group members page, fixed public/private groups and added group settings page˚|# Todays devlog

Today I started to **completely transformed** the interface into a more structured, *GitHub-inspired* dashboard layout(with browser extension). 

> I made only the devlog page for now, but I will be making the hole website.

Let me know if you like it, or if you have any suggestions.


### Redesign Preview
Here pictures of all the things I redesigned:ÄTurned my skills list into an interactive physics ball pit. Learnt how to use Matter.js and was reminded that I hate JavaScript.@added css loading but it resets when you reopen the browser AHHH˚"I have *no idea* how I managed to accrue nearly 22 hours of undevlogged time - I think hackatime must be having a bit of a silly moment (or the time that's displayed when I write the devlog is just wrong).

I have been working on some new optimisations which should counteract a big ol' performance regression that I had to introduce  recently to maintain scratch compatibility. Now, the first few iterations of each loop are unrolled (in the hope that the types of any variables stabilise to a single basic type after a few iterations), and I've implemented a little bit of const folding to help wasm-opt out, as it can't optimise string operations.

I have no suitable images today as the only thing this changes is performance, which is tricky to take a picture of, so have a picture of a llama.˚˚ Here I learned about

.I started my first server on 4000 port˚øI've written and finished the ``ft.exe auth set <USER_ID> <TOKEN>`` command. This command saves your authentication token and verifies it by sending a request to the Flavortown API. It also gets your username based off of the user id. It then saves it in your OS' keyring, along with your User ID. If you choose, you can disable token verification with the ``--no-verify`` flag. The next command I'll be working on will be the auth delete command.XI am still working on perfecting the model. I have also finished the flavortown adapter.bDone many things so far, created github repo and deployed on vercel.
Created landing page so far.*add more commands and play with code hhaha˚AWelcome! I've opened up the project for the first time in 3 months, and I've been experimenting a little bit with controller support! Right out of the box, the movement seems to work great!
Also, the "Exit" button now works if you click it and you're not on the web version, something previously implemented but ignored!Improved Term Date Logging˚*I've done a lot of cleaning up of the mess I just created, but I've also added support for files (--file) and stdin (e.g. pipe). It does need a bit more polishing to make it robust, but it works half-decent for now. I've also added go tests‚Äîmostly for fun really, but useful to have in the future. And lastly a simple workflow to run these tests and build it on every push to Github.

After finishing the tutorial, I debugged some of the code (not sure why the tutorial didn't entirely work?) and changed the way the game exits (rather than exiting after X seconds, it only exits when the user closes the window). 

Next, a start screen was created and game states were added. I also fixed the issue of the collided block in the snake disappearing when game over. The game over screen was updated to include a RESTART button so that users can return to the start screen to replay.˚_Ok so I finally got the first simulation working:

The Chaos Game! Here are the rules:

1. 3 random points are randomly picked anywhere on the screen
2. A random point is picked completely randomly on the screen
3. The random point then randomly chooses any of the 3 points and then a new point is added halfway through it.

Using so many randoms, one would've guessed that it was a messy pattern but that's not what happens in the simulation!

Now I will work on adding GUI, ability to change other parameters etc.

(Keep in mind I have NEVER coded in C++ before and this is my first time EVER)uAdded the stats page where group members can view the group's listening stats and see their place on the leaderboard.˚Figured out how tiny usb works! I wrote tusb_config.h, which oversees the configuration of all the different drivers. Ultimatly, the msot important bits of code were setting the buffer size and enabiling the HID driver. This was definelty a process, though: I was coding while reading teh documentation, so it took a bit of time. In the comments, I documented what each function does, so it should be easier to port into another project. From my understanding, CMAKE will interpret this file and encode the tinyusb features.9Added basic shop UI & Smart Suggestions got even smarter!§Finished Electric circuits and I finished newtons second law faster progreess and attached the photo of collisions i forgot in my last devlog(used some ai for this)˚ÓIn raycasting algorithm I cast a fixed number of rays in the field of view of the player, if field of view (FOV) angle is X, then the area visible to the player at a particular time would be equal to player's current angle (line of sight) - half of FOV angle (X/2) to player's current angle (line of sight) + half of FOV angle (X/2). The rays will be cast in this particular region till they meet an obstacle (wall) which will give the depth perspective of that particular point wrt the player.;I am working on a surveillance car which is quite exciting.we offer you the brand-new uiu- Created dark/light mode feature

I finally got the platform position generation to work. I realized that in the game I got inspiration from, the camera moves and not the actual platforms. So I tried to figure out how to make the platform distance and height be random. I almost thought I had it since I was using code from my flappy game to randomize height between instances of obstacles, buttttt i had to reference the last added instance to also make the new instances have a reasonable distance between the old and new instance. I did manage to figure it out through looking through docs and indexing the last added child in the scene tree. Took me less time than it usually wouldDeployed using streamlit here i am i comleted the project˚(Devlog endpoint implemented and i rebuilt the fetcher to use concurrency. Training is working just like before. I should be ready to ship but i would like to make a better UI using catppuccin + next.js so it'd be a bit nicer to use and fit with my other project's theme. Not publishing currently.˚∂Major update!!! Finally completed the major features for the subscriptions tab by adding most of the popular subscription bundles, pricing plans, and more options. This meant I could finally move on to working on the accounts tab! Because the logic is mostly the same I just copied most of the code from the subscriptions tab over and changed/deleted some things to get the accounts tab working quickly. Added a lot of services and their assets for more accounts, as well as the custom service option so you can create your own account provider service. The accounts page supports both cloud database storage syncing and guest mode local storage, and the page displays the total number of your accounts, add account modal with detailed customization options, account search, edit, and deletion. Because Subtrack is storing very sensitive data like your passwords I had to spend a lot of time researching secure encryption/decription/cryptographic stuff to finally get everything securely encrypted and working (except there's a major loophole where an attacker can just visit the API endpoint with a MongoDB user id and get all their decyrpted data that I'll hopefully fix in the future by finally implementing proper JWT that I've been too lazy to add). Idk why but I always make dev logs near midnight and this one is way too long so yeah major update ok time to go to sleep now.
Edit: looks like Vercel prod deployment failed holy bro so much to fix tomorrow˚ÄFinished DFS. The problem was that It got confused when all neighbors were visited. Also i said != when i ment to say ==. Basically, now it stores which way it came from and if there are no neighbors, go the the parent. Then if that parent had any leftover childs, use those, otherwise go to the grandparent, so on. only don't consider it as stuck if visited == total number of nodes.˚0I've been working on my site, Open site to help make AI open sourced and useful, I'm currently developing ideas to add more applications to the site so people can use without downloading, subscribing, or entering log in information (still working on it but the site is live now on GitHub and Netlify.) :)Eworking on first project, feeling hella tired (cooked sleep schedule)˚gHello guys, I just coded cards, what it is is that you click the collision body, which is the squares, and after you click it the flip_card() function is called, which makes the card visible.

I already have 9 hours logged, but I haven't even touched the gameplay yet. I'm really working hard to get the engine perfect and expandable.

Endian is going to be very similar to another discord bot MMO game I made before called Adriencoin. Both are in C++ and made with the Discord bot library D++ so there are no worries of me having trouble or having to learn about any of that.

However, I have never made a game engine like I am going to make for Endian. Endian's engine (Engian? That would be a fun name) will be very data-driven, meaning that I will be able to add commands, items, locations, spaceships, etc. by just writing JSON. The code will then be written in C++ and compiled to WASM, so that it can be ran in a safe and sandboxed environment. 

As you can see in the photo attached below, I have made some decent progress on making the mods load. I start the server with the instance called test (I really wanted to make it easy to use different instances because it was a pain while developing Adriencoin having to switch between release and development modes). You can see that the instance directory is properly selected, and then it scans the mods folder. It finds the base mod (endian-base) which has one namespace inside of it (endian). It then starts up the discord bot.

That is all it does for now. My next plan of action is to make the discord slash commands fully data driven which will be fun.Added the reproduction mechanic, it is currently set to exactly six members. This means the base game is complete, I shall from here on add customization and programming features.

Assigned phase netclass to all output phases, to provide thicker traces.ÍTried to implement DFS generation but theres an error in the logic so it blocks off and there is no path through the maze. Also i spent a lot of time debugging that i didn't change the value of the selector to dfs, only the innerHTML.hAdded repeating tasks, tag management, updated UI. Next will work on long-term goals and focus sessions.VI'm working on my first project! I'll try to make something cool hopefullyllylyll!!!!!˚£1) Updated the way the bots work and take rules to instead of using really long confusing eval statements you just write a method that returns an integer. 
2) Added a bunch of helper functions that are exposed to the bots, so that the users can add them to their rules. For example, my bots used to always stalemate, so there is a function that returns the number of repetitions so that you can add negative incentive for stalemates. Thats one example of a method I added. 
3) You can now see, edit, and delete the version history of bots.
4) You can upload JSONs to upload bots and rules from files. You can also download old versions as JSON.


To Do:
1) Add a new way to write bots, instead of just writing the evaluation function to a negamax algorithm, the users can write the full AI from scratch, they get the helper methods and board state as input, and need to output the next move in algebraic chess notation. 
2)˚6After lots of trying, the genres work and the general storytelling is also improved. I did this by asking the llm to generate the prompt for the prompt to generate the story. This extra step doubled the intro quality. Also it turns out the crystal ball's animation was somehow causing the button (which triggers it) to lose track of genre so it kept returning None. So now that the crystal ball has its own separate trigger with the button that issue has been resolved. I also adjusted the creativity - temperature - down a little because gptoss was going too crazy.I just finished the basic grid thing. The next steps are:
* Build an X marker for cells
* Allow the user to make his own pieces, like dominos
* Construct an algorithm (maybe C++) to find a covering of the the grid using the given pieces.1redesigned the UI of discover page , and AI chat.˚IThis update adds admin-restricted API endpoints for exam retrieval and updates, supports question management (multiple choice, short answer, and matching), and ensures data consistency through transactional database operations and schema validation.

Currently underpopulation is set at three or less neighbours, overpopulation is set at ten or more neighbours. All living cells check neighbours and THEN their next state is decided. Also added a skybox.Ïworked on the core ecosystem logic and visuals. added moving organisms on a canvas, animated population bars, and improved how plants, herbivores, and predators interact. also cleaned up the ui so everything fits on one screen (mostly).∆Now we finally have a minimally functional gameplay. I finished configuring the sprites, now it doesn't take 16 years to load, and I adjusted the sizes, I also made some necessary minor corrections.˚µA bunch of things happened. I made a detector for Sinytra Connector in crash reports. I also made the function necessary to get the modlist from a Neoforge crash report. It was a lot of annoying regexes.

I improved the overall UI by adding a more engaging background, better spacing, and a cleaner card-based layout so the tool feels more polished and easier to use. I also finalized the calculator flow, making sure unit conversions between KB, MB, and GB work reliably and that results are displayed clearly. Finally, I organized the project files, pushed the final code to GitHub, and deployed the site using GitHub Pages so it can be accessed as a live tool.”I just noticed that I forgot to save the latest version of my PCB design.........!!!

I have been insanely cooking, I learned about camera transforms so we have camera zooming, camera rotations and just being able to move it :D i will be adding more functionality like being able to switch the camera currently being used, but thats for the future. I also made great work on the UI ststem, how it works is there are premade anchors but more can be added and basically you attach ui objects to these anchors and they will autofix onto the screen if the object is too big, I have to do other things before it is "done" like adding buttons and text, but thats for the next devlog$Devlogs are the bane of my existenceHAdded manual state changing and tweens for transitioning between states.˚5okay mega devlog. In this log, I have made the interface and functions to communicate with an OLED using I2C. Big shout out to adafruit for linking the docs for the 1306 chip on my oled. The first thing I did was make the font for the letters I would use. I realized there wasn't a library, so I hardcoded each letter as an array of 5 numbers, which when in binary show the letter. I then implemneted algorithms for I2C, such as teh start, stop and write. Then I wrote helper functions for commands and data. Then i wrote the initilaization script (which took the longest) where I had to use low-level commands for the oled to work. I scraped most of tehse from the documentation. I then moved a tad more abstract, where I implemneted clearing, updating, and drawing algorithms. In this process, I think the biggest thing I learned is how I2C works; before I just imported a python library haha.  I made sure to add comments such that this code can be re-used for later projects. I think the next thing I will be workign on is the USB HID, which hopefully won't take this long.˙Added a downloader for git and lazygit, made a runner (thing that runs stuff) and made a few things more extensible and easy to create!

I'm working on making a command-line interface for Flavor Town. My goals are to integrate the Flavortown API directly first, and afterwards, add more complex logic. I'm aiming to make it feasible and easy to create devlogs and manage your Flavor Town projects right from your command line!
So far, I've made a quick Rust skeleton (yes I've decided to learn Rust for this) using Clap, based on the current API. Next steps will be to add a command to save your API key, integrate it with the Flavor Town API, and then work on some more complex logic after that.0He hecho una animacion para la funcion de picar.˚ÌSo... just doing this project to learn sql and as a project to show that i know what im doing (even tho i dont) for an internship opportunity. idk what else to say. set up github so thats cool. first time using nbs. im a c++ nerd this python and sql stuff is kinda wierd. its oddly easy. yep. idk. we shall see!

I finally have some resemblance of a working project. Now, stocks are actually displayed on the site. A lot of work was done to get here.

## The details
Firstly, I needed a market class so I could run the simulation on all stocks. Thankfully, I just needed to wrap the the class with a "Market" class that runs the simulation for all of the stocks. Next, I worked a bit on the database. I actually chose a different approach to the database than previously stated. I instead created a new sqlite3 database and use sqlite3 on python to access it. On the Nuxt side of things, I chose not to use prisma and instead use the better-sqlite3 lib to communicate. I still use prisma for users but, I don't think it would have played nice with python. Also  on the simulation-side, I made the stocks load from a json file. This is great because I intend to allow people to merge in their own stocks to encourage creativity. Now for events, I actually have the AI prompt pretty much done. I also implemented events that communicate with the OAI API. For now, I just print the events and I have yet to actually implement the generated events but I have a solid framework for it. I also implemented all the API routes to communicate with the market database. This allowed me to create a functional Market page. This allows me to just fetch it from the frontend easily.

## Next Steps
I'm putting events on hold for now. I don't even know if I'll implement them with the AI stuff. I want to work on the actual buying and trading of stocks by the user. I don't think it'll be too hard to implement. I'll also work on SSE/polling so the stocks live update. I'll probably poll because SSE (Server Sent Events) are a lot of work. But I want to learn SSE/Websockets since i've never really used them before. I also want some sort of onboarding for users. I might also look into allowing hackclub oauth instead of also github oauth.˚zFixed an issue with keyphrases affecting encryption/decryption. On signup the encryption code was encrypting the data with a key "", which is just empty so decryption of the data with the correct key "{the actual key here}" was returning an error all along. I Fixed this error, but i need to change my password storage method as the appended json is not getting stored on the db˚ÆWho knew authentication could be so hard? I finally got this working with supabase, and got both discord and google authentication in (by request of band members). The issue is, google did not want toa ccept my custom URL scheme as a valid redirect so it took me forever to implement it a different way (with a web browser and a library, that somehow offers a paid tier?). Anyway, here it is! everything works with supabase too :)“All the sprites have been successfully loaded (a lot of work, my friend). Now it's time to fix the size (before, the image size was over 3,000 wide and 6,000 high).

It was because I was iterating on it twice :(((

Basically done now.≈I had to remap the sprites because they were making the game too heavy, and I'm stuck on that part. Basically, I'll have to readjust the entire game (because it used to be huge and now it's small).˚$I improved the security architecture by removing the ‚Äúkeychain singularity‚Äù and implemented project-scope identity instead to prevent collisions across multiple repositories. I also introduced process lifecycle guards using Pdeathsig that makes sure secrets are removed from ram immediately if the process is unexpectedly terminated. I also shipped the teleport command which is a PAKE-encrypted feature that uses the Magic Wormhole to tranasmit Master keys peer to peer, which bypasses the need for centralized ‚Äúdead drop‚Äù servers entirely˘Timing and detail level functionalities. Timer is to give the user time to zoom in or adjust the frame to what they want to see so they dont have to move nonstop, detail level reduces detail which is good for slower computers or arbitrary complexity˚Æthis looks like little little work, but i cried for DAYS to make this work on an actual simulator and i am so happy about it!

Worked on: many many configuration files, cried over broken dependencies and "pods"
learned a lot of new things, mostly crying, about mobile compiling and bundling
Now i have all configurations ready for the next steps.

Completed layout, not found, home, starting to look at navigation and so on!˚Hice una app web para un centro ortopedico en el que el fisioterapeuta, doctor, etc pueda agendar citas y se le recuerde un tiempo antes, como para tambien llevar un control de tienda de su centro ortopedico y alquiler como por ejemplo cuando se alquila las muletas le avise cuando se vence etc. el user es Dora23 y la contrase√±a 1234, hay aparece todo de igual forma hay veces en las que no aparece todo correctamente por que lo estoy hospetando en un servidor gratis por que no tuve para pagar uno y es algo pobre de eficiencia.°Added functionality for save as where you can select resolution, filename, and extension. I also fixed a few bugs with the date filtering for the date selection.%Added Particle Effects to the Charger˚Added a machine gun enemy who shoots lasers at anyone unlucky enough to be in his way. Added variable flight heights for the jetpackers via indication(red lines ) in the tiled editor. Also projectiles actually collide with the player and decreases their (invisible thus far) health.˚UPicked this project back up after about a year of it sitting stagnant. Added password support for the multiplayer rooms, fixed several networking bugs, used a different websocket watching system, began reworking the game selection screen and mechanics, and cleaned up the code. 
I left this project in quite a mess so I need to get working!˚·3rd Devlog! I fixed the parent and child thing so that the children properly inherit their parents positions, and i also distinguish between global and local positions now, i also made some handy things like printing out the scene tree for debugging purposes or getting the descendants of an object. As well as the objects I also began work on the anchor based UI system, more about that next devlog, I feel like im getting close to my first ship! So stay tuned, Have a good day :D˚≈![Logo](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/raw/main/.github/assets/logo.png?raw)
# Changes
---
- [f7eec2d](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/f7eec2d583588fc42b55027061f1b78d2219b642): I added some serialization functions to all the new URL-related structures, refactored the URLPath structure to be more representative of the specification, and integrated the new URL infrastructure into my existing HTTP client code.
---
# Next Steps
- Implement the HTML parser (for real this time)
---
## Note
---
The next devlog is probably gonna be a BIG one, like 5+ hours minimum (most likely) - given the fact that the [HTML parser specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html) is just so LONG. I've been reading through it and the main state machine literally has 80 states and that's not even the entire specification because there's probably a billion utility functions and side quests I'll have to go on to implement it right.˚óI am still trying to figure out why the themes won't work. I just realized that I told it it was a fantasy storyteller in all of my prompts so it keeps default to fantasy. I know I need a better way to keep track of genre than just prompts so I am going to put it in state, a permanent location that all the llms can always access. I am going to consider other changes once I finish fixing this genre error.∆Finally dealt with bad files, hopefully next time i make a devlog it won't be garbage :D
Anyways asset was made, now need to find a way to export this.
All main functionality is there now at leastImplemented lyric support$worked on overflow and final touchesPopsicles and pizza!ôSite now splits apart the slug value with multiple sessions and doesn't freak out with one session. Now, I need to figure out how to process each session˚#Now I've implemented a drawTriangle function, refactored the code to make it more flexible in the future, and I've created added normals to the Triangle struct so I can add lighting next.
The drawTriangle function I've currently implemented is quite inefficient but it works. To draw a triangle it basically looks at every pixel in the rectangle which encloses the triangle (the bounding box) and checks whether it's in the triangle and if so it draws the pixel. There are better ways of drawing a triangle but they are more complicated and I will focus on optimisation later.
I've added an Entity struct which I hope I could use later on to be able to add multiple objects in the scene. For now it makes the code more organised and provides a convenient way of applying transformations to an object in the scene without directly updating the position or normal vectors in the mesh itself.
Next, I will add flat shading to objects by using the normal vectors I've created. Flat shading is easy to implement but looks very blocky with obviously flat sides so I plan on later implementing a better shading method such as Phong or Gouraud which will add more realism. After implementing flat shading I will probably implement a Z-buffer so that only the closest objects are visible and objects behind don't overlap.˚œFixed the Charger Doing its animation on load
Added Battery Recycler - But it only recycles stone batteries [atm](https://www.google.com/search?q=atm+abbreviation+meaning+in+chat&sca_esv=dc6ec19e7dc4ebae&sxsrf=AE3TifOlszD8zrMsXqkMpuxG-BWs6-kmHQ%3A1767050608274&udm=50&fbs=AIIjpHxU7SXXniUZfeShr2fp4giZ1Y6MJ25_tmWITc7uy4KIeioyp3OhN11EY0n5qfq-zEMZldv_eRjZ2XLYc5GnVnMEpKlG2EjNHY-lAPkrr7LqoidfsIjLWzVuJCR3nFhKFl4dIfrrU8A7Wt6lqS1kABxiVLYFex6XmnIkYiJJPS_NDUO9tDzBa3V_6-xEHkQKC5LLmYpSm__EZx2W7LNI7CCwM0ucjw&aep=1&ntc=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj1s7m--OORAxUkQkEAHQlHCgEQ2J8OegQIERAE&biw=1528&bih=698&dpr=1.25&mtid=dg1TaZaVEMCHhbIP-8a30AE&mstk=AUtExfDHeIqqzyAJq49Ssxp_AYXdYd5rl0er9I4sO1dlON-cnAwXdQ-xfVNJHK_qFq_lOKNNbNyCB3GWoaUTxNbu6VxmxAzn9y_y_p6Rnq0CuFPJmuirGQuXk6bi8GY2wwhY2iYLwyLKzCTcuny-2WcbgNMdvfp9qL5QndWDddvYbupYlBQ0UrXNMBuOfHtxFhfDt1R6cHNWnFwqTpmeIbsaaz8mdlPDESl9LQosT9VPbhcPO-YfZmrruX9IaRk2eLvM6Z-YcQPxg5F2oDpklqZNqIG3FIMzillL8e5NpMYrB1szf0nHm8SLwZFPpEVgGwqTjb19AxtQrc8IdA&csuir=1).˚{Just added textboxes, and learned how to animate them. Coded many things today such as text box appearing when something is clicked, or a game popping out when the box is clicked. I learned about deleting animations after reset. And I have been sending it over to GitHub so you guys could go and look at it. Anyways I'm going to show the video of what the game looks like so far.˚∫Added more features to the plugin

- Added config file system - users can configure the plugin as per need.

- Added blacklist blocks - users can blacklist some blocks like barrier blocks, command blocks etc

- Added weight-age system - with each round passes by increase the block difficulty, with first round the blocks will be easy.

- Added nether end blacklist system - user can ban the items from these dimensions in config filecWorked on Stopping the app from showing classes during the holidays (even if it were a short flash)cWorked on Stopping the app from showing classes during the holidays (even if it were a short flash)˚O que foi feito hoje:

I also worked on the code that successfully transforms the database data into protein embeddings. Currently, I'm working on the diffusion model itself.tI worked on adding a new grade calculator for my project and this will be one of the task that is able to do for it.¨Made it so that the language syncs to the color (ex, TypeScript will be blue, JavaScript yellow, etc). I also added the functionality to select what range you want to view.æAdded in hours information and time by language. Learned CSS grids for the first time, and it actually wasn't too hard! I was also able to do it just using documentation, and didn't need AI.¬Finally, I adjusted the board to the standard chess layout (white pieces in positions 1-2 and black pieces in positions 8-7).
I also fixed some data inputs after becoming aware of certain bugs.ÿAdded a simple draggable card system that lets you rearrange the widgets into any way you want to. It still gets reset once you reload the app, so I need to somehow save the position of all the widgets and load them.\Added different shonk variants and some more presets!!
Why this took so long? I dunno (T_T)„I didn't do fraud I promise! I was testing how to do stuff in Kotlin and I couldn't figure it out cuz the guides are Java but finally I did! Now the bot responds to mentions! I will build on that to do the actual recipe giving!404 and 429 page buff˚ok so i didnt actually do much coding, but i did do some research into express.js and other questions i had. I've uploaded a pic of my notes below. i found out how i could implement rate limiting later, but most importantly i figured out how to user express-session. this should be really helpful when making multiple users later. in order to store user data though, i would need a database like redis or postgre. its also probably best if i switch from storing jsons for file metadata to using a db since it will probably be accessed very frequently. so it looks like the plan is: switch from storing jsons to postgresql for file metadata; use express-session to allow multiple users and connect it to the postgresql db. i still want to do some research into how express-sessions actually works first, though, since its not obvious HOW exactly it authenticates the user. anyway, the coding i did do was just getting the frontend to fetch file metadata from the endpoints i already set up. not done yet, so i havent pushed a commit÷I'm still trying to implement the AI feature, Ollama is being really buggy and I might just give up on it. I really can't figure this out, it keeps returning empty. Though I'd make a devlog before taking a break...Added in trust levels˚zI started the project off by using Svelte for the frontend and Go for the backend and developing backend auth in go. Since I'm quite new, it took a little while to get the hang of it and I had to use a lot of google but now I have a working auth backend in go using JWT tokens! I also imported a login page from shadcn and next i'll try to wire the backend and frontend togetherdI added loading gifs to the pages that did not have content, and that is to prevent the "404 error".˚YWow after only three hours |: I was able to make a stick that spawns spheres at the press of the action button and after the release of the button the balls get in one layer and follow the player. Wowie. No idea how I will go from this to a working magic writing system but hey at least i got enough motivation to try something in unity again (:3He has the new ability!!! (That's really scaryüò≠)˚I finished the movement mechanics, imported assets, added animations, fixed a bug where the player could wall jump, turned the level into a tilemap, added a background, worked on the base of the start of a level, and worked on the death mechanics/animation.˚Ï# v0.3.0

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/TKanX/bio-forge/compare/v0.2.2...v0.3.0˚IT FINALLY WORKS!!!!!! This is the first time I've ever tried making a bot in Kotlin so it was hard and the Slack guide is outdated and for Java. But Gemini 3 Flash came to the rescue!! Now that I've done the basic boilerplate, I shouldn't need the AI again!! I'm so happy it works!!˚ZServer status is now implemented!
How it works:
* Client sends a handshake packet
* Server receives handshake packet and updates the clients state (for getting info for the server list that is 1, as requested by the user in the handshake)
* Client asks for server information through a status packet
* Server responds with information such as version, player count, MOTD etc (Here i decided to send a player count of None as its not implemented yet, the "???" are intentional)
* Client sends a final ping packet to get response time
* Server responds with a ping packet and closes the connectionKOKAY REAL DEVLOG THIS TIME, markdown support is now fully added i think yes˚EAdded functionality that allows mouse movement and zooming to also register as offset input, that didn't take me too long but I tried two times to try and split my main file into two separate files and no matter what I tried to do it wouldn't work because I'm not smart... my main file is getting close to some thousand lineseTried out the app Qt Designer but could not really make something out of it, will try again tommorow.èStarted basic UI for the page; also added in esc key shortcut to exit adding sessions for efficiency an also added a 404 page for missing users°Added security: username validation and ratelimits. Also started on adding notifications, most of the backend is done and now I just have to finish the frontend!!Add threaded replys and CDN Dogs!devlogZTrying to implement support for markdown in logpheus
<u>meow</u>

i like <u>potatos</u>∑Wrote my readme
Added popups for the skills section that I added
Added a change in the title when you navigate between the pages
Added contact form linked with formspree (my email)˚]This is my first devlog on this project, I started to outline the project and created a basic third person player movement system. It's boring work, but once all the basics are out of the way, I'll be able to get to the meaty details. For my next couple hours I plan on coming up with the actual style of the game, and improving the player movement.kbetter and longer output results with actual context from assignments from classroom
and better animationsi am making a keyboard˚)I added 2 different enemies.
Firstly a jetpacker that flies with his... well his jetpack. He also shoots scary energy balls that deals damage to the player. Secondly a spikeball that follows the player and deals damage on contact. Right now all jetpackers are hard coded to fly up to a certain distance, but i will add so that you can change in the tilemap to where they shall fly. I might also add pathfinding to the spikeballs. Next thing to do apart from already mentioned is to add additional enemies and draw a few (hopefully nicer looking) tiles.˚ Completed the FULL ADDER schematic!!!!!! Btw here's some of the things I changed:
- Added an inverter to each gate for output
- Added diodes (tbh Im still not sure whether I should use diodes or resistors.......
- Created hierarchy sheets for AND, OR, and XOR gates (SUPER SUPER USEFULáOk i got stucked at a silly thing in JS so used Ai (Yea it was silly and little) , Website is Ready ‚ú® 
Will be Shipping it Very Soon˚With todays project, I seached long on the internet for answers on how to create and animate a textbox in GODOT, then I found a video, it helped me make a Dialogue Manager, which is the start to animating text boxes. Then I moved on and started my first quest for Mickey Mouse, where he is going to have to click a box and a puzzle which I will decide and start making will meet him, and there will be a time limit for him to solve the puzzle. These are what I plan to continue and hopefully finish today or tomorrow.Ûi worked on the first 2 fruits(working on the 3rd fruit). Also side note, my screen recorder was messing up the code that makes the player always look at the mouse.
(I can't ship this bc I'm 12)
The video below is what I've worked on so far!˚E# Haiiiiiiiiiiii

sadgagagdag˚\I couldn't wait to get started, so I decided to start with a hashing algorithm, since it seemed like the easiest to implement. It took me a while, but everything went pretty smooth. I wish I had implemented a better skeleton though, as I currently only have a template for hashing functions, but nothing else. This might haunt me in the future... For now, I've added md5 and sha256 just as an example. I've also added the project description to the README file.

feat(cmd): add md5
feat(cmd): add hashing command
feat(cmd): add hashing algorithm
feat(cmd): add hash.go
docs(readme): add description˚5Make a lot of stuff sync to reduce async overhead, cause my code had a lot of stuff that didnt need to be async. Also fixed registry order as that was unpredictable ending in chat getting messed up. Screenshot shows an example of change in one packet. Also includes some work on trying to optimize the server.I added globe functionality after a lot of time spent confused about maplibregl versions. You can also now save the current view as an image (todo: add loading symbol while it's fetching all the layers) I also started adding a filter popup.˚Added: all images, all sounds, music, player shield, UFOs, score saving, settings file, setting window in the game, pause window and a lot more (see changes in the commit)
Commit: https://github.com/Daniel908009/Asteroids-2/commit/4eeca373fbf192064075c5b40c2dc882dbae8843˚BMostly got the project and TCP connection running as well as packet parsing. Server can read the handshake and parse its data as seen in the image below. All packets are handled by dynamically registered handler functions making it completely modular and expandable. Ill go implement the status packet + response now, baiiAdded settings page˚*So far I have a first working-ish version of the program, it is supposed to be accurate to 1000 digits right now and is only accurate to about 120 so I imagine there is a rounding error somewhere, but it is a first version. Also needs insane optimization because right now it is really really slow.˚Added 3 new commands
- /bs quit => only users playing block shuffle can run this command to quit the game they are playing

- /bs help => help guide for new players

- /bs about => about the plugin, about the developer of plugin and latest version of minecraft plugin˚It took so long trying to get the beaver to appear on web pages, I also implemented the actual speech feature and a sleeping model when you don't interact with the beaver for a bit and fixed the other beaver emotions. I also implemented an onclick function.˚¶So i drew new textures! and added them to minecraft

but drawing fire_aspect was suuuper hard idk why but the fire just dint look right but smh i got somewhere that i'm really proud of and then also made a new sharpness texture which is just a glint which i think is appropriate for sharpness and then made one with both together also this was my first time making a animated minecraft texture and its surprisingly easy!aSo i am done with the code
and now I will fix any issues with it
But this is what I have so far˚ZLogic is in place for Pong, and the built-in `update` and `draw` callbacks have been implemented!

Performance is very much awful, however, which is to be expected, as I had been more concerned with getting functionality in up to now. I'll now be mostly busy with profiling and trying to get the VM to run at a reasonable speed (the hard part, since this is all done in JavaScript...)

Please, wish me luck.

> (P.S: a fun thing: the callbacks are implemented as a hidden bit of code tacked on to the end of the user's source code, as you can see in the second picture. I thought that was funny.)˚BWell I don‚Äôt have much more time to work on this on flavortown so I‚Äôll ship it as is; It works; It lets you create the haj‚Äôs profile and then redirects you to said profile that you can share to people. More to come in the future but i probably wont log it here to avoid double dipping (except if its allowed but idk)aMany improvements on API + responsivity
TODO: implement profile settings page + profile picturesÜi sat down and added more stuff my back hurts right now but i am so surprised at my own progress maybe i am not as washed as i thoughtCOauth2 flow goin well
and i made a really really simple login page˚jI created some integration tests to test the actual working APIs and check that everything works as expected... and it doesn't, obviously. So I spent some time figuring out what was wrong, I rewrote some parts of the SDK that handled communication with the enclave and fixed some bugs with the actual API handling (like how multitenancy was handled client-side).Ω- Fixed all the minor bugs
- Added colorfull text messages to the server
- Added solo mode, if the user is alone in server, he can play alone.
- Improved the timer from 3min to 5 minutes˚|I have successfully built the core of Cloak, a secure environment injector. The cryptographic foundation and the file storage are fully working at this point, and it allows users to init a vault and set encrypted secrets. The ghost engine (cloak run) is working too, and it's able to inject these secrets into child processes in memory while preserving any interactive TTY signals. I've also implemented a semantic merge tool for binary conflicts and scaffolded a cyber punk themed TUI (cloak edit) for managing keys, which is basically the groundwork for a secure, developer centric secrets manager that never writes plaintext to disk.RAlmost finished. Only a few finishing touches left and my project will be complete˚Ive been working on turning my program into a website, using streamlit i made a basic website template. 'st.camera_input' (a built in streamlit function), rather than complex webrtc code to create a simple button that takes a photo. Then the program processes the image and returns the celebrity face that looks the most like you. The reason i didn't opt for a live camera feed was because i was having troubles with the feed glitching and not working properly on the website, i will try to fix this for the next devlog! :)˚new work to make decent visuals, tried to make a beach but i don't think it's working too well :(
i have at least some water and sand, but the sand moves so it might look weird. i'm gonna try to add clouds, day-night cycle and some extra shading/decorations.üI added a lot of code to the JS
The code I added today was the message, players move, players position and timer
This is just some of the code I have written\Line, point, and area features are now rendering from the database. Only editing is left now\Line, point, and area features are now rendering from the database. Only editing is left now3added a fitness penalty if the snake is in "danger"˚AI continued going through the SDK's tests to verify if every route worked as expected and fixed some errors regarding the creation of objects. Now objects are successfully created as they should and those tests are passing! I had to fix how multitenancy was handled and a bug regarding the enclave's attestation document.|added highlight animations to the tools used for the projects to make them stand out
added my skill set on the projects tab˚éüï∑Ô∏èI wanted to create something that feels emotional, not just visual. Web of Time is inspired by Spider-Man and the idea that every second matters. The clock, web, and city represent choices, responsibility, and growth.

I focused on bold colors, strong contrast, and a clear center to keep the design powerful but not crowded. The biggest challenge was balancing time elements with the Spider-Verse vibe.

This project helped me understand visual storytelling better‚Äîsometimes less is more. In the future, I‚Äôd love to add small animations and interactive effects to make the experience feel alive.

Every choice shapes the web. üï∏Ô∏è‚è≥˚ZIn this update, I focused on building the core functionality of the File Size Calculator. I structured the main input flow using HTML, allowing users to enter a file size and select source and target units such as KB, MB, and GB. The majority of my time was spent working with JavaScript to implement the conversion logic, handling different unit combinations accurately and displaying the result dynamically when the user clicks calculate. I also tested edge cases like converting between the same units and ensured the output updates correctly without refreshing the page. Styling was kept minimal at this stage, as my priority was functionality over design. This devlog helped me better understand how JavaScript interacts with user input and DOM elements, and it set a solid foundation for improving the UI and adding advanced features in the next phase.∞Still working on slug stuff, but also decided to add in a footer (it's not Aftonsparv until we put in an actual Aftonsparv). I'll probably add some links to the footer as well.˚{lots of changes, i added functionality for individual subreddits instead of just one, added profile support, im still working on individual posts like comments, and working on being able to interact through the api on your own account through the ui. i have the feed from the serverside, cached entries to avoid unnecessary requests, and a proxy that most traffic routes through.˚Uthis devlog is purely to record the agony and pain that i've been going about making a settings menu with

tldr; im struggling to make something that looks nice and feels right for this sprite; HOPEFULLY in the next devlog ill have something thats up to spec 

in the mean time here's what the basic notification looks like at the momentâCompleted the PCB design of XOR gate!! I tried to make it as compact as possible

GUESS WHATTT, IT'S TIME TO BUILD A FULL ADDER!!!!!!!!˚uAdded items. You can pick them up by getting near them and pressing shift to pick them up. There are IK solvers for the hands and the transforms of the hands are attached to their IK very similar to the legs, but the sprites are only visible when there is something held in the hands. There can be two things held at once. 
I also fixed a lot of the collision filtering because I was stupidly putting the f suffix at the end of hexadecimal literals. There was also a bug where the category bits for the level weren't working and I had to apply the filter to the chain definition instead of the shape definition of the rigidbody.fNow you can send and download files in the local network, yeah, and you can use vpn to make this wider&I've added icons to all of the buttons˚˝ Testing out the library PyQt6 for the future UI, tested out the capabilities and functions of the library, I will try to make the whole UI for the project using this library. I also made the start of the next session which is the log in page of the app.•I made some modifications to the code structure. I changed the name of the chess.c file to game.c, added the game.h file, and I'm trying to organize the code better.˚˘A bit tired -w-
Didn't make any big changes
Just refactored the backend so that the API to fetch assignments was more flexable by letting the frontend set a start and end date to fetch assignments for and so that it could show old uncompleted assignments

And I also made it so that the completed assignments would be ordered by completion date
And I also did some cleanup (better readme, added license, made assignments look better by adding a `<br>`)
You can also see the date you completed it now˚	I accidentally deleted the original devlog, it logged 9:30h and went something like this:
- Started this project!
- Made my own JSX runtime
- Implemented a URL pattern pattern string parser
- Implemented URLPatternList
- Implemented URLPattern.compareComponent˚∏Finally completed the schematic for an XOR gate. Despite building it on the breadboard, I still struggled with whether I should place a diode or a resistor.......But after doing some research I decided to go with a diode, and here's the reasons:
- Resistor regulates the current indeed, but it's based on R=V/I, so the voltage drop is not fixed
- Diode, on the other hand, ensures a 0.7V voltage threshold, preventing current from leakingŸNot much written, but a lot of research done.
I still have a lot to learn regarding borrow checking and multiple ownership or whatever its atually called
but arc mutex got my back for now il see how long it lasts xd˚\# **Widget**
Widget data syncing finally works, *perfectly*. Spent like 2 hours reading the Apple dev docs, but worth it,  cuz finally bridged the gap between the main app and the widget.

The hardest part isn't the UI, is getting the app and the widget extension to actually talk to each other. becuz they are in separate sandboxes (i hate dat)/Fixed some errors, made executable & ASCII art.˚ÆAdding Slack ID works now. Currently, it redirects to a 404 page; however, that will be fixed soon. I decided that, for multiple sessions, the slug value would be a single string of all sessions divided by a keyword "[x]" so that I can parse that slug value easily. This also makes it easier to share links between people without having to go through the UI multiple times, which wouldn't happen if I used localStorage like Oskar.¢Done with finding the resources, and writing the base html code...now need to work upon getting to know readymade js file and then include all my functions in it.˚nSO i was finally able to finish revoke access had it do the below checks to make sure there was no logic based error in the code  
 //the flow should be check the auth key from headers and verify and then deocode the info
    //get the project id and user id to be removed from the body
    //check if user owns the project if yes then let him do
    // also check if the person being remove is not the owner
    //check if user already exists in the project 
    //remove the dude from the project
and I also made a video of it and also made sure it shows the right error when the person is added and removed and something is incorrect it took me more time to think and make the query also i enabled RLS via an exists call to make sure few conditions were ensured by the query it self and to ensure the security of the application IDK why my application is kinda slow not sure if its cuz of next.js or what it could also be cuz my vm is in us and im not based in us its pretty far from me so could be that also but ill take care of that during deployment

It's better than before but the text in the HTML canvas is somehow thinner on mobile than on Desktop?? I'm guessing that it has something to do with the pixel density but I don't know how to fix it (if you have any idea then please tell me üò≠üò≠)
In addition to the site being a *bit* more responsive, I also added preset color combinations, I'll probably add a few more in the future! Apart from that I tweaked some small stuff.
Overall I feel like I'm pretty darn slow. The *seemingly simple* project is about to hit 24 hours of logged time...
I'm almost there though, I'll just make some minor QOL changes, add different Shonk variants (and maybe an option to insert your own) and... cry while trying to make the site mobile compatible and make the color distribution more even when... it can't properly distribute them evenly (T_T)ùWorked on mvp version of minecraft plugin

You can now read the readme file. You can check out the website.˚@After the AI model is trained on what makes a good form and what is a imperfect form, i wrote a 'decider' script, that first calculates the angles and joints of the person (the same variables that the model was trained on), then "model.predict(current_data)", triggers the custom trained model - karate_model.pkl, which contains hundreds of "decision trees" to check wether a stance is perfect or imperfect. If over 85% of the trees agree with the perfect stance, the stance will be judged to be good. 

However, this isn't enough, for a person to properly learn the stance, they need feedback, just like a real sensei would. 

Once the program thinks that your stance is 'incorrect', it enters the coaching stage. It runs your data through a priority based system (the order was decided by the ai to be the most important variables in a good technique). It will show you the first mistake it finds at the top, once the most important condition is satisfied, it will move on down to the next most important until it deems your stance to be perfect. 

Next i am planning to work on the ability to do this for multiple stances, as at the moment the model feedback will only have the correct order of importance for one stance. I am also looking to implement voice commands from the sensei so you don't have to look at the screen every time.˚√![Logo](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/raw/main/.github/assets/logo.png?raw)

- [5fb1292](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/5fb1292e938668dfdc338c6ca5082b54dd06df2e): As promised, I worked on IPv4, opaque and domain parsing. That concludes the host parsing algorithm, it was a LOT lengthier than expected;
- [7728d02](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/7728d023e6ce7133cb8b965d142bcd98ea2e2dfc): I completed the ENTIRE [URL parsing specification](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-parsing)'s implementation. This took WAY TOO LONG. Seriously, there's no way parsing a URL is THAT deep. For reference, the entire implementation spans almost 1500 lines, consisting 4 different individual parsers (IPv6, IPv4, Opaque, Host), 5 different encoding sets, 27 different custom errors, that all come together with a 600 line long state machine to parse a URL.

1. sleep˚óToday I started working on my new project File Size Calculator. In this session, I focused only on creating the base structure of the project using HTML. I designed the main layout in index.html, including the hero section, title, description, and the basic structure for the file size calculator interface. My goal for this phase was to define how the tool would look and flow before adding styling or JavaScript logic. I made sure the HTML structure was clean, readable, and ready to be connected with CSS and JavaScript later. This helped me clearly plan where each feature (inputs, unit selectors, result area, and buttons) would fit in the final application.ùits coming together but i took way too long
- did a lot of css and experimentation
- style the Nav bar and footer
- i learnt a lot more about tailwind css˚IFilewise Devlog #1 ‚Äì ‚ÄúStarting the Build‚Äù

Username: purawavy
Date: 29 Dec 2025

Today marks the official start of Filewise, my context-aware file organizer for students. The goal of this project is simple but critical: to help students manage and organize their academic files efficiently, without the headache of manual sorting.

Progress so far:

Set up the project environment in VS Code

Created the initial project structure with modules: scanner.py, organizer.py, preview.py, undo.py, and main.py

Installed required Python extensions and verified the environment

Prepared a test folder to simulate student file chaos

Next Steps:

Build the file scanner to read files in a directory and categorize by type

Implement the renaming logic with a preview feature

Add folder creation and move functionality

Test undo functionality to ensure no data loss

The focus for the first version is a working MVP that organizes student files with minimal input. All features beyond that‚ÄîGUI, AI-based context detection, and professional expansion‚Äîwill come later.„Connected the back and front ends, so now it's functional. Btw, small tip: NEVER trust AI on front-end animations, you'll end up having to rewrite 95% of the code because of how poorly optimized it is lol

TODO: implement ADsìMight have forgotten a screw terminal in the old design.. well that's fixed. Also had to change it a little bit to make it fit the now smaller psu.*finished the combination quick time events˚CSoooooo... Since the last devlog I've been thinking on how to sync your snippets through cloud and dividing each user's snippets through authentication (I'm also working on a browser extension that allows you to create a new code snippet by selecting text on a page). The thing is that I never worked on authentication and authorization. Probably the best way to learn how those work is by creating a project that forces you to learn them. In the end, I'm here to learn, so here's what I've been up to:
- Frontend (Web Page/Extension) -> Just login/signup interface + Snippet Data collection
- Backend (NestJS + MySQL) -> Gets the data from the frontend, stores it and manages it
Wish me luck as I'm trying to learn NestJS, MySQL, JWT and session management all at the same time. I'll be here documenting all the pain along the way.II added achievements. Fully customized to my taste heheheheheheheheheheheøMade a vegetable complaint box that throws complaints at you. Also changed keybinds to be more appropriate.

### Summary:

Introduces the official **BioForge Web Application**, a high-performance, browser-based interface for molecular structure preparation. Built with Next.js 15, React 19, and Tailwind CSS, this application leverages the `bio-forge-wasm` crate to perform all heavy computations client-side, ensuring data privacy and zero-latency feedback. It features a fully integrated 3D viewer (Mol*), a reactive pipeline configuration system, and a robust state management architecture utilizing Zustand.

### Changes:

- **WASM Integration & Core Logic:**
  - Implemented a singleton WASM loader in `core/wasm` to ensure the heavy binary is initialized only once.
  - Developed a `PipelineExecutor` (`core/pipeline`) that orchestrates the execution of Clean, Repair, Hydro, Solvate, and Topology operations directly in the browser thread.
  - Created a robust file parser (`core/file`) capable of handling PDB, mmCIF, and MOL2 templates, converting them into managed `FileEntry` objects with live WASM structure references.

- **User Interface & Experience:**
  - **Design System:** Created a comprehensive set of UI primitives (Buttons, Inputs, Sliders, Cards, Badges) styled with Tailwind CSS and `oklch` color spaces for a modern, accessible dark mode aesthetic.
  - **Pipeline Panel:** Built interactive configuration forms for every operation (e.g., pH sliders for hydrogenation, ion selection for solvation).
  - **3D Visualization:** Integrated **Mol* (molstar)** for high-performance 3D rendering of structures. The viewer supports instant updates between processing steps without reloading the page.
  - **Interactive File List:** Implemented file cards with expandable details, real-time status indicators, and batch processing actions.AFirst devlog, created general structures and learnt JSDoc syntax.ÔFirst devlog
So far I've been researching, planning how the ADS system will work and prototyping some pages with AI so I can see how they look, and will refactor them later. I also implemented the authentication (this was by hand tho lol)•I am following the guide of creating my own web OS.
I worked on the Welcome screen, created a bar, and made the window draggable. I will work on the rest later now.©i added the home page image scrolling animation ( image shrinks to center when you scroll ) and also worked on the background moving marquee ( its kinda sketchy rn lol )`Added the group's playlist page, where members can share tracks and collaborate on the playlist.ÃFixed an issue with the mobile device. The video wasn't going all the way down in the mobile view. It took longer than expected to fix this issue. Now I'm ending this project and gonna start on a new one.˚For this Devlog, i tested out a lot of things, improved the item and the dropelement models, so that the dropelement has a border, showing its containings (the items) with a function to get these items inside by droping them at the dropelement, and getting them back by clicking on them (isnt working currently but will work in the future). As well i improved the generell lock of the Gameview so that it shows every already existing element, for example the timer.

Video is 3x sped up because video was too longñWoohoooooo! MASTERPLAN! I made themes in the website, solving the problem of some people liking the old design, and some people liking the new design.˚SIn this session, I significantly expanded my Student Productivity Hub by adding several interconnected productivity features and fixing existing logic through debugging and refactoring. I implemented a full Pomodoro Mode with automatic 25-minute focus sessions and 5-minute breaks, including a live mode indicator and a Pomodoro counter that persists using localStorage. I also corrected and improved the Daily Study Goal system by fixing data-type issues from browser storage, ensuring accurate progress calculations, updating the progress bar reliably, and displaying clear feedback when the goal is achieved. In addition, I enhanced the study history system to store all completed study sessions and built lifetime study statistics that aggregate total study time across sessions. To support better data control, I added a clear history feature with confirmation, which safely resets stored data and updates all dependent features like goals and statistics. A substantial part of this work involved debugging JavaScript execution order, resolving DOM-related issues, fixing syntax and logic errors, and restructuring code so multiple timers and features could coexist without conflicts. Through this process, I gained a deeper understanding of state management, countdown timers, persistent storage, feature interdependencies, and real-world frontend debugging˚# Todays dev log

## settings tab
Added monthly multipliers for fees and base fee setting that can update all students at once. Made dropdown to switch between settings and months now show in proper order jan to dec.

## payment tab
Search by egn or class works client-side so its instant. Shows unpaid months from start date with calculated fees based on multipliers. Year filter included and months with 0 multiplier are hidden. Payment modal pays oldest months first, calculates resto, lets you pick cash or bank transfer and saves exact payment time.

## database changes
Updated student_payments table with year column for multi-year tracking, payment_method column for cash/bank, changed payment_date to TIMESTAMP and made unique constraint use student_id, month_id and year.

## reports
Added daily payments report showing todays transactions with student name, month, amount, time and payment method.

## student notes
Added notes field to students table, shows as textarea when editing.

## fixes
Payments respect multipliers, students pay from start date forward only, client-side search is instant.

## future idea
Fiscal printer plan: web -> backend -> python app -> printer.
let me know if you have any other idea for the connection with the fiscal printer˚”I found a lot of bugs and inconsistencies when testing the OS for example when I wanted to add Opening and Reading Files in the driver or when I tried to fix ListDir, which is still somewhat broken btw. I decided to restart and look at the linux kernel documentation and code to understand EXT4 and get my Driver to work. So currently, I've re-done the Superblock, Inode and Block Group Descriptor structs and enums. I also noticed a bunch of fields I should've been using like the `s_first_ino` or `s_rev_level`. The superblock was also the wrong size, like having a `uint64_t[32]` array which would've really misaligned the superblock struct. I also added a ton of nice comments explaining how various parts of EXT4 work.˚!I decided that i wanted to increase the amount of celebrities listed, but im lazy. ;(
I built a web scraping program that uses a variety of free apis, all you have to do is give it a list of celebrities and it will find the photos and leave them in the folder. This process was very fustrating, originally, i planned on using duck duck go api, however i kept getting ratelimited and i fear my ip adress is now blocked. I moved towards using wikipedia api, however not all the people had wikipedia pictures that were easy to find (they need to have a thumbnail property image designated). to improve with the quality of wikipedia, the program can now ask for search suggestions, this means if a direct match fails, the program can ask for the next best match.
FInally, to make the scraper ensure that it works, i added functionality for TMDB, the movie database, it is a professional database for actors and singers, is significantly faster than scraping and almost never blocks you. 

The program first goes through TMDB, then wikipedia, finally duck duck go.

Also, for faster opening times, the program will do through the .pickle file, detect if there are any new photos int here, and automatically decode it into the .pickle file before startup. This process only needs to be done once per photo so it makes the whole process a lot faster.

Uhhhh. so basically i forgot to post a devlog previously and i just worked on this new bit without posting my first devlog so this times wrong. I spent around 5 hours on this bit and the rest was on the first devlog.˚'ü•ä Devlog ‚Äî Baki Hanma vs Kengan Ashura (Fan Project)
üöÄ Project Idea

This project was inspired by a simple fan question: What if Baki Hanma and Kengan Ashura existed in the same universe? I wanted to create a cinematic web experience that feels like a Netflix-style crossover announcement rather than just a static fan poster.

üé® Design Approach

The main focus was intensity and impact. The split-screen layout represents two worlds colliding. Dark arena lighting, bold red typography, and strong character poses were used to give the page a raw, underground-fight atmosphere.

üõ†Ô∏è Development Process

I began with the hero section to instantly grab attention. Navigation was kept minimal (Home, Characters, Fights) so the visuals remain the highlight. A lot of time went into adjusting contrast, alignment, and layering to keep the design powerful but readable.

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges

Balancing heavy visuals without making the page feel cluttered was the biggest challenge. Small layout tweaks made a big difference in keeping everything clean and focused.

üìò What I Learned

This project helped me understand visual hierarchy, composition, and how to turn fan ideas into polished UI concepts. I also learned how important restraint is in design.

üîÆ Future Plans

Add character detail pages

Animated transitions between sections

Fight matchup interactions

‚ù§Ô∏è Final Note

This is a fan-made, non-commercial project created to celebrate two iconic anime universes and explore creative web design through storytelling.TCompleted the testimonials section (aka the wall of love!) and also animated it too!hAdd Suggestions for a better essay :D
I added suggestion on the backend side but forgot to devlog it D:˚	Spent a lot of time searching the internet for resources and watching tutorials more than I did coding. I'm happy that I learned new things, but still I struggled a lot to understand CMake and Qt. The problem with Qt is that all tutorials use the Qt Studio. It is a powerfull tool in fact, but I hate it. The software introduces a tool for designing a UI (the whole purpose of the Qt framework) graphically, but coming from a wxWidgets background, I want to code the UI, not doing it like a Figma project. It is possible to do what I want completely in a coding IDE (like VsCode), but I cannot find sufficient tutorials for it (any suggestions would be helpful). After some struggling, I got a window showing, and learned few things from the Qt website. It turned out to be very similar to wxWidgets; I jsut want to get used to the new naming system.

Why I moved from wxWidgets? It is very limited. It lacks transparency features; the UI has that 'native' look to your OS and a very basic, boring design. I was mostly motivated towards Qt when I knew about Audacity (a popular, free audio editing software) moving to Qt from WxWidgets. I then knew about other popular apps (like Davinci Resolve and Maya) are also built based on the Qt framework. 

The aim of this project is to build a free, open-source desktop app that could be used to produce motion graphics videos, inspired by Adobe AfterEffects and Cavalry. The app will have the basic functionality at first, then I will add more complex ones based on my motion graphics background.2Fixed User Name not showing

ALSO BASIC MINGAME PROTOTYPE˚_It takes a long time for the local worker dev server to reload compared to a fastapi server which was run directly, so I decided to develop using fastapi instead.
The problem is that the local worker server injects secrets and D1 bindings to fastapi requests' scope, but a server ran directly through fastapi can't access that.
So I created functions to check if it is running through fastapi and let the program read secrets from the local .dev.vars file and access the D1 database through its REST API instead.
This should also allow me to use breakpoints in vscode, saving me hours of headaches later.aBasic things so far but updated a string from using a print for each operator to using a for loop˚:lmfao i was trying to figure out why my menu wasn't aligning to the right and why `right: -15px;` seemed to work and eventually i pasted the code into chatgippity and i had another ruleset targeting the same element and there was `margin-right: 1rem;` there i'm so blind even with glasses that have +3.5 power üò≠ÏFinally implemented flavortown support after constant pushing for the API to work now.

When I use a PC I do not trust (like a school PC with an outdated version of Windows and a disabled antivirus (for some reason I still have not figured out)) I do not want to plug in any USB stick or open my password manager, which is problematic since my passwords are 10+ characters long and randomly generated. I often resolve to typing them by hand, which is annoying.
Now, I can simply open up this website and scan the QR code to transfer anything from my phone to the PC.vV2--> Added a data logger to help log and store data about the user and imput it in and be able to connect everything.˚Using the face-recognition library - built on dilb, the program finds 128 unique points on a face, making a 'face print', which is a signature unique to each person.  Then, the averaging logic takes multiple photos of celebrities, takes the 'face prints' of all of those and calculates the average, for better accuracy. (this was implemented later on). 
One of the issues i faced initially was that it took a long time to calculate the math for these faces initially, to fix this the first time the program encounters new files in the library, it saves the finished math into a .pickle file, so next time you open up the app it 'reads' the math, instead of re-calculating each time.
Then, for the real time comparison (the cool visuals), it turns your face into a 'face print', then using media pipe to map points on your face.  It calculates the Euclidean distance between your face and all the celebrities in my database, using media pipes pipe mesh, it turns redder or greener according to how similar (or not) you are to the celebrity.»Added the shows view using temporary placeholder data. Also, fixed the theming of the footer - turns out I was using the wrong color constants earlier. Now, the views work on both light and dark mode!»# dev log

¬≤ https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/issues/4496#issuecomment-2574286099YWrote README.md, still WIP on pushing to github. found linker scripts for the MCU online.˚ˇ Started with actual origin shift! Made it generate the base maze, which would look like the other file i uploaded(edited in preview, that was painful) shows how the mazes work. The green is what is stored in the code and the blue is the corresponding maze˚Interface for adding sessions is mostly complete. All that's left is adding auto-focus for the form field. After confirming the list of sessions, a new panel opens up which will ask for Slack ID. After I get Slack ID, I can process the information and get data from the API.˚HI spent quite a while working on fixing more cursor issues since it kept bugging out 50% of the time. After that was fixed, I worked on integrating catppuccin into the editor as the native colour scheme! I plan on making a scripting language or just editing source files so that the user can have their own themes in the future.†Created the project in unity, created the player, ground, and platforms. I also worked on movement mechanics. I am still working on movement but need a break rn8Added a reset button as suggested. Thanks for the input!˚˚ Started intense work on the boilerplate for THE firmware. I imagine it will be the hardest part of this project.
Finished routing IMU, yay no ratsnets. still working on the ESC module, thinking about how to place it on each arm and away from the IMU.Voptimised UI for iPad, fixed the UI crash of settings view, and added menu bar support˚*Hello! If you're just stopping by, feel free to follow / star this project!
But anyways, this devlog logs two new pages added, including a guestbook page (which replaced the photography button on the navigation page), as well as one featuring my Cubing stats. The snapshot feature seems to kinda be working now but that's probably something I'll be working on in the future. I'm overall pretty happy with the turnout, and I'm beginning to get a good grasp on react. Hopefully I can be coding mostly without claude as my crutch by the end of the week? :)˚*the plan was to make api web and app in 1 repo but found out we can add multiple Hackatime so changed the plan now instead of using SecuroPass repo will be using 
SecuroPass-API
SecuroPass-WEB
SecuroPass-APP

and added events on api to handle error so code don't stop and fixed some port issueáI fixed the editing UI for devlogs so the colors match and look nice. I made all state-neutral cards have proper colors in the kitchen.˚4A simple mechanism took me a whole hour to fix TwT when the player enters the range of the blue circle (shown below) a text buble should pop up saying press E to interact or something like that im tired its late. I wanted it to turn on when the player came close and turn off when the player was far but the NPC (currently not drawn just a placeholder) was activating the circle so i had to edit my code to something much smaller and simpliar so im happy some tables have been placed ill proably go back to drawing next to take a break but thats a tomorrow problemadded caching˚Gwent a bit overkill on the README file (ts not even done yet adsfefk)

i used a invisible character U+2065 and spaces to create the space between the badges
and then added just enough spacing that it takes up the conventional  desktop github README view width
github flavor markdown doesn't allow css nooo

looks nice tho˚!Setup initial CSS and background; took a bit to work out a color scheme that is easy on the eyes. Starting to work on setting up the session selection UI. Additionally, I'm being more conscious about <h1>-<h6> body tag hierarchy and using CSS to modify text size rather than choosing tags.˚ÈI added the initial files for the library like the adore.lua that handles most of the interactions within, like what gets draw, i made it so all the "objects" inside of the drawables table are drawn (y sorted too) (ill proly make that configureable) and its very efficient drawing system that culls off screen objects, i also made a very nice call that makes me an object that takes in a few parameters, handeling all the mid parts of making objects, If anyone has read to this point, you probably actually care and ty, and also this is actually a recode! I have made this lib before, however it ran poorly and had minimal features, which is why im bringing it to flavortown and i even make a cool custom logo for it :D, anyways have a good day.˚˛Now I've got the engine rendering a rotating 3D wireframe cube.
I created some new Structs for Vertex, Triangle, and Mesh. A mesh contains a list of vertices and a list of triangles and the triangles are just indices to three vertices in the mesh. This is quite a flexible system that I hope I could later use by importing .obj files to render meshes created externally, for example in Blender.
Getting here required some math for example the projection calculations required to convert coordinates in the world to coordinates on the screen to display. I also needed to use 3D rotation matrices to rotate vectors allowing the cube to rotate.
My next goal is to create a drawTriangle function to rasterise the filled triangles of the mesh to make the meshes solid.⁄- Completely moved to serverless NextJS
- Created Google Sign-in with Google Cloud Console credentials
- Allowed users to create 'Spaces'; however, saving to those shares (in plugin frontend) is a 'work in progress'.˚Add admin panel for exam management with admin-only role-based access, migrate middleware to proxy following Next.js 16 latest documentation (https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/middleware-to-proxy), and support multiple question types (multiple choice, short answer, matching).‹I wrote up the code for the vim movement motions (which took up wayyyyyyyyyy too much time) and I also added cursor that is visible in the different modes (insert, normal, etc)! The app is also in full screen by default!VCompleted the PCB design for the four gates!!! Btw i also ordered the PCB this time!!!Started initial game work≤I've added the beaver sprite and made it smile when hovered upon, it's really cute and a nice buddy to have while browsing! Now I need to add the actual features/functionality :),Vulnerability fix. Prod environment launched˚`for this update, i have:

- spent a lot of time refactoring and thinking about what the rate page is going to look like
- added two new functions to pull things from the database
- spent a very long time thinking about how data should be stored inside the database
- spent a very long time thinking about how to minimize cost when updating reviewséRouting PCB & finishing up ESC schematic. Kinda switched to routing PCB as a little break activity from ESC schematic (routing is lowkey fun).1I changed the UI to more of what I was aiming for,Just built a simple sidebar for users to useeBuilt the base of my to-do app, will add repeating tasks, tag management, and AI functionality later.`Did initial setup of CMake, VCPKG, and the folder structure. Also started work on the tokenizer.(I'm just making a pranking app in python˚%I have started downloading many different photos for characters, or downloads for fonts, learning new things everyday. I made a text box, and didn't realize it needed alot of work, added so many child nodes to each node. Anyways next step is to animate text boxes, make puzzles, and get rooms."Buttons, webring, and social icon!´Completed schematic for AND, OR, NAND, and NOR gates!!!! Can't believe I proceeded that fast lol, but Kicad still made it way easier than prototyping on breadboard trusttt"Sign in page is basically finished˚Improved UI & UX, snowflakes animation. Uploaded the source code on GitHub, hosted the game using GitHub Pages for being able to play it just by opening a link and made it an installable Progressive Web Application (PWA). I also optimized it to better display on mobile phone screens.˚ìI built the UI and base project for portkey. This includes setting up all of the base code for the TUI, all the way to reading SSH connections. I coded a way to read your ssh config and figure out what SSH connections you have stored. I have also made the sidebar UI that showcases these SSH connections. Soon, I will fill in the rest of the UI working features. Right now, this space remains unclaimed.«Did the initial set up regarding the react-native and android studio set up as well as doing a hello world! This is my first experience with react native and creating apps in general so wish me luck!U˚0Multiplayer is very complicated... and I don't to use AI, so... I tired (the way I started building the game didn't help at all) and since it doesn't make that much difference whether this game is multiplayer or not, I went back to single player.

You can test it at: https://joelmohh.github.io/zombie/added new bogre dishes˚1I am just doing more frontend work. The crystal ball finally works. I am just going to continue working on the website UI. The title is always blurred and that is very annoying. I need to fix the title page but at least the crystal ball is fixed. I didn't really change the backend flow, I just edited UI.*Added the ability to delete and edit bots.+Added admin tooling and made security fixesRemade the focus timer˚:Created the scores logic and made it a bit more challenging. When someone loses it will shoot the ball to the winners direction. Also increased ball speed and it spawns in random position on the Y axis. Might change from potentiometers to buttons as it gets tiring to play lol also will add 2 player mode sometime.˚GLearned how to code, and add scenes on GODOT. Made my character move, this is a wonderful experience for me considering it is my first time using this soft ware. Plan to make this a good game with time. Next step for me it to make minnie mouse talk, make text, some puzzles, introduction to different rooms, and a happy ending.ÀI worked on giving this task a time and a way that it can work So I was able to code a second file with the times and the dates which helped me as I update this code hopefully it would work to be easier.±I switched my code from making HTTP requests to the APNIC website for WHOIS queries to using the whoiser library, as it seems like this will work better for queries to ARIN IPs.êThis is going to take a while, and there's nothing to post every hour, so the next devlog will probably only come when I finish the multiplayer.˚uToday was also a cleanup and polish pass across the art pages, b/c I tidied up the HTML formatting on all the galleries so things are more consistent and readable, and while I was at it I added a new painting, ‚ÄúUnchained Reverie,‚Äù to the Art III Painting gallery! Also the modal got a small but nice improvement, it can now close with the Escape key. I also added a proper footer on the main page with copyright info and a little site credit, and did some minor CSS fixes like adjusting spacing, updating font families, and cleaning up modal styling. Again, hopefully stuff looks more polished and cohesive to the viewer now.]All checks pass, and keplerian_sim v0.7.0 is now live! https://crates.io/crates/keplerian_simÔI continued planning my project.
I finalised: 
-> what it will do (predict exam scores and give tips to help students based on their input)
-> what technologies it will use (Python/Flask, HTML/CSS, scikit-learn, etc.)
-> it's structureûUpdated the footer to show ultrafastparrot webring, slightly tweaked the technologies swiping thingy so there are more borders, and added an edit name button.ÅI have made the first demo of this project. The demo will include 3 bollards. I look forward to adding more bollards to the demo.ÅI have made the first demo of this project. The demo will include 3 bollards.

folder creation tomorrow:tm: (maybe today idk)¬Finished researching ESC choice, finished symbol and footprint for the ESC IC. WIP on wiring it up. GOing to use one of the ESC's internal regulator outputs as source for logic power (5 or 3v3).˚]I haven't done any Python in forever so I just started working on coding a mock-up of a Pokemon battle as a little bit of a warm-up. A lot of it was just reviewing a bunch of Syntax that I forgot and fighting the VS Code terminal. So far I've kinda defined all the functions for the main battle menu, the health bars, and a way of executing attacks.hI'm still working on the room system, this is going to be a hell of a lot of work and I'm already tired.He could jump now!!!˚#Basically starter code, creating the base. I made 3 files for the website(html, css, js) and added elements to the html that i knew i wanted. I need a canvas to show the maze, a selector for which method to generate the maze by(I plan to have at least 3 but i'm gona start with origin shift), a range for how big to make the maze and the solve button. In js, i added the listeners so the label for the size changes as you move the slider and it makes the maze as soon as you let go(right now empty matrix). I also made the css dark mode everything˚MI got the website to look a lot better and I got new genres. One of these genres was cyberpunk which I have attached. Additionally, I made some functions because gradio requires that to help connect the website to the chat. One of this was having a new generation when the story starts. I am still trying to get the crystal ball üîÆonto the website but its a lottie animation so its harder. gpt oss continues to give results without giving me any rate limits, so that's way better than openrouter. I am going to continue to try to make the website better and add small features like that.˚øI caught the wrapper up to speed with the current state of OpenRouter's APIs for the most part
# Added functionality
- Audio uploads
- Image gen
- Proper plugin support
- Fetch usage data for current API key
- add getGenerationStats and getKeyUsage to OpenRouterStream

# Bug fixes
- I forgot to let people upload PDFs when I added PDF support lol
- I forgot to make getGenerationStats send the auth token when I made that function
- OpenRouter changed their API so `finish_reason` had proper typings in the docs now + added `native_finish_reason`

# Misc
 - Types are easier to use now because they're more individually exportable

# TODO
- Let users use `"usage": { "include": true }`Ahttps://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01504DCLVD/p1766967430071599˚Now the location gets formatted nicely instead of just showing country and region codes! I think this is the final data format I will use so I am going to try and move on to supporting registries other than APNIC. I want to support ARIN next but it seems like it may be tricky.˚I fixed the year display above the slider to position itself above the thumb and also edited the style JSON to fix the bug with country names. I changed the input fields for the year as well to be more sleek (design by my friend). I probably did some other things but I forget what.ôtables were added working on trying to make an interactable npc at the moment codes confusing me rignt now but im taking a break then getting back to it.¢Just finished the GUI implementation for the Mixture of Experts! It's fully complete and commited to GitHub, and also looks pretty good! See for yourselves below:NOrganizing the files and final testing, now on to the backend and multiplayer.‹So I worked on the home page of the site. It only contains one animation though. Like I tried to add for the Q n A area but couldn't üòü. But I hope to get it done. Like now I'll focus on the core functionality of site.styling, navbar changes˚PI applied the same fix to both decrypt and session_unwrap handlers. Now they both call the enclave's route for get_attestation and use the attestation for decrypting with KMS. Then they return KMS's CiphertextForRecipient field to the enclave, that in turn decrypts it with OpenSSL and re-encrypts it with the session key/client ephemeral public key, so that the proxy NEVER sees the plaintext DEK.

```
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec."
```
the browser fetched the html file properly but it couldnt get the css and js files that it referenced. I thought it had to do with the base url in the vite config, since i was building static files and servign them. i'd seen this same problem before and changing the base url worked. it turns out it was Caddy this time. i used `handle_path` instead of `handle`. `handle_path` strips the path prefix so it was looking for the js and css files in the wrong place. lesson learned! hopefully, i never make that mistake again.˚Ë# Devlog
I worked on the stock market simulation. It simulates crashes, surges and regular market movement. I'm pretty happy about how the market movement ended up turning out. I also used a python notebook to take a look at what the market actually looks like. It's really unpredictable while also being somewhat logical which is exactly how I want the game to turn out.

## The details
The simulation is a simple python script with a scheduler that will run the market on a regular interval. The plan is to have python communicate with the same database as Nuxt. This may introduce some challenges due to Prisma, but I think it will work out as long as I follow the schema set by Prisma. The Nuxt app will handle buying and selling on the backend while the python app just moves the market simulation forward. SQLite should handle this fine.

## Next Steps
Now, I need to work on random events powered by AI. The market is already super unpredictable and quick so I need to make them noticeable and make them carry very heavy consequences. To implement events, the python "Market Manager" will communicate with the OpenAI API to get a description of an event. I think events will be mostly random with only the description being handled by an LLM.QDark mode, general optimizations (thumbnail compression, ect), style improvementsûI helped build a company called Ryzor which is basically and AI native google drive. It can organize documents with folders but it is still under development.⁄internal code-cleanup from lack of standardisation from names (xdd) so everything's a bit clearer to work with as well as a bit of refactoring

the start menu has icon support btw
working on an awesome settings menuòLoaded in map data rendered with uNmINeD -- for Java and Bedrock support -- and displayed it using leaflet. Also implemented nextauth.js for future use.˚˚ Researched the IMU datasheet, and options for SPI or I2C. Decided on SPI and MPU6000. Considered the tradeoffs between easy to DIY solder and newer more noise resistant IMUs. Finished up the IMU schematic according to datasheet, routing it on PCB now.˚oVery sleepy, been waiting in the queue to interview for RED so not much progress done. Also kinda done with this project and python as a whole. i miss rust XD
Either way, patch notes:
- properly implemented some kind of audio processing for files marked as bad quality
- added another setting
- fixed session and settings saving
Gonna ship after I make assets :D˚I started working on the app! It isn't very far along yet, as I wanted to build some constantly visible UI components first (such as the header). I also added auth through the auth.js library, with both Slack (though I can't showcase that until the site is done and hosted) and Google.˚àAdded some setters/getters for the Window class so that you can do things like changing the title and window dimensions
Will also later include more stuff i think but for now window sizing is about the only thing i can think of :woman_shrugging:
I also plan to have them return a reference to the window so you can do function changing
anyway here are some silly error messages you can getTesting out functions of the library Dear PyGui for the future UI, today I made a program where the window opens with a button and when you click the button it transfers you to the other window and you can click the button again to go back.˚ˇThanks for the feedback! In response to it, I added the following things:
1. Added a <title> element to the website so the tab shows Zain's Portfolio instead of the url
2. The "View My Work" button now links to /projects instead of #projects. I forgot to change this from when it used to just autoscroll to when it switches tabs. 
3. Added a bit more to the README.md
4. Added a header to the technologies section 

To Do:
1. Add images to all the projects
2. Write more CTF write-ups
3. Make a favicon7Added a nice therapeutic animation to upload button :))˚à(I wanted to work on my other project, GameLISP, but it's borked until the website is fixed so, I guess, docgen work :-P)

There's not much to talk, except that the project is undergoing a restructuring. Rather than one single .md file generating documentation, this will be a slightly more complete solution for projects. It will still, at its core, be a documentation-focused Markdown to HTML converter, but it will also be able to extract documentation from code comments!

It should be relatively simple to write a regex to match a wide variety of comment styles (I'm thinking users will also be able to write their own regexes) with the only problem coming to mind being strings like, for example, `"// not a comment"`, which would get erroneously matched... I'm afraid the users will simply have to Deal With It.

As internal code redesigns are not very visual, have a code screenshot insteadFinished˚¿I fixed the way the server handles key generation by moving the logic from the isolated enclave to the proxy, using the enclave's cryptographic attestation document to guarantee zero-trust.

- I SPEND 5 EXCRUCIATING HOURS TESTING HOW THIS KMS ENCRYPTION SYSTEM WORKS BUT FINALLY I GOT IT!!!!! Credits to this super helpful answer on stackoverflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/77985003/21306952 -

The proxy then sends the results to the enclave, which securely decrypts the new keys and re-encrypts them with a public key provided by the client, so that the keys are cyphertext to the proxy, but can be decrypted locally by the client.

The enclave-proxy system now finally works as it should!!!!!˚üThis is my first devlog for creating my 3D graphics engine from scratch using C++ and SDL3. After nearly 3 hours of coding I've successfully drawn a triangle to the window.

During this time I created a drawPixel function which draws a pixel on the window by updating the frame buffer. I then created a drawLine function which draws a line on the window using Bresenham's algorithm. It allows drawing lines quickly and does not require floating point values which makes it convenient to use. The drawLine function will also be helpful later on when creating wire-frame models.

I also refactored the code into .h and .cpp files by creating separate classes for Renderer and Window which makes the codebase cleaner and easier to navigate especially as I expect the code base to increase in size a lot.

Next I hope to create some more classes for meshes, triangles and vertices so that I can eventually display 3D objects.{Stretchable window, better ui. made it so that selecting one option deselects the others stuff like that. Collapsing window‰Added [Hack Club AI](ai.hackclub.com) in the form of '/ideas', which generates a random dog themed project idea and ALSO added '/dogpics' which rn uses stock images but plan to include my dog, @Will, @AVD, @gamer_waves dog pics!˚ÕeBay developer APIs are difficult but I'm figuring them out. This app is very information dense so a lot of the time spent has just been getting a semblance of UI for testing, and getting ways to put in all of that information first. For example, I had to find a data source of all CPUs, find a good NLP model to get CPUs out of the page, go on a side quest getting access to eBay APIs, and I still don't have it making any decisions based off of that data yet!$Added category sorting on video page˚XI worked really hard for this to do the javascript since im a beginner at this, it took much more time than expected, hopefully it was worth it. Now the storing code is somewhat functional, where it is possible to write code and it will get saved locally.
I will do some more work later on css and maybe some additional functionality to the JS˚—I am trying to improve the gradio frontend by bringing the crystal ball üîÆ back. Additionally the switch to gpt has actually benefited me a lot because it's a lot faster than the old olmo model. I finally fixed the list issue also. It turns out that instead of slicing lists to get lists over and over again using [][][] I should have just went in with a for loop and gotten whatever message I wanted.
I am going to continue making small improvements like these.&finally got around to writing a readme˚–I improved the visuals of the project section, moved it to its own tab, and changed the way the project cards look. They are now much wider, and horizontally laid out. They each display the title, an image, a description, and the technologies used using the same cool hover effect as they do on the home screen. I also made it so that I can quickly add new projects by just adding objects to an array in a typescript file rather than messing with the svelte files.eBlocks with transparency effects, minimum distance between blocks, and significant code optimizations:I now have a basic ui for making a profile for your haj :3˚Finally, I managed to fix the building upgrade bug (it was turning completely black) and implemented custom sprites.

(the video doesn't show it well but pieces are actually blocked from moving when king is in check. I will add visual feedback later to make this more obvious to players)qI'm working on my first project! I can't wait to share more updates as I build, for now, heare is a quick sketch.˚”The latter goal has been achieved, and I have added three helper functions that can retrieve environmental values!

`getEnv`, `getEnvOrNull` and `getEnvOrElse`. The first tries to get the value and throws if it can't be found, the second simply returns null in that case and the third returns whatever you passed from the lambda (for when you maybe want to do user config via `.env` files!) Alongside this I added fitting JUnit tests for them (which was a beast, I liked tinkering around with the somewhat unused JUnit asserts, like `assertThrows`, which checks whether the code block provided throws a certain exception, handy in the case of `getEnv`.)

Now the only thing that remains is components and perhaps files.˚\Today I spent an hour and a half working on the Flavortown Wishlist application. I started with a simple prototype and gradually added advanced product filtering, search, price slider, sorting by name and price, and an option to show only limited items. The biggest challenge was solving the CORS issue with the API using a proxy server and properly setting up the sticky layout so filters and wishlist remain visible while scrolling. The result is a fully functional web application with a modern design that allows users to easily browse the store, manage their wishlist, and track their cookie budget.˚oStarted to integrate the OpenDota API to this, and it's been going pretty great! The API has lots of fun endpoints, like a wordcloud or a list of all of your peers (friends) that you played with. To prevent users from sending too many unnecessary requests to OpenDota, all responses are being cached in localStorage for 24h and then used instead if they already existfFinally got an idea in mind.

it turns out pygame doesn't support m4a so I had to use ffmpeg to be able to run it, which is only possible by converting it. you might notice a slight delay when playing an m4a file.˚ÔWebhooks are stupidly simple, yet when I check to see if there are any ready-to-use wrappers with some decent DSL I can only find either bad ones, or old ones. Because of this, I decided to make my own since I desperately needed it for Khat (https://github.com/Tywrap-Studios/Khat), and maybe for other projects too, may they use webhooks.

In this quick session I added the bare-bones basics of webhooks: simple content messages and rich embeds. No files, although I might not add those, and no components. Considering Components V2 is very nifty to have, however, I am excited to try to implement using it through more comprehensive DSL.

So that's next up, I want to add Components (V2) support, and utilities for getting environment variables.˚7# Features

I have gotten back to just changing the logic. But I am having a huge type problem. I don't know whether the what happened in the story is a message, list of messages, or some combination. I have gotten lots of out of index and attribute errors. It's very tricky because there's lists of messages of lists and I need to figure out how to work with them.˚cFirst devlog, woohoo! Cubby is a past project that I want to pick up again. It's pretty barebones right now - hopefully I'll be able to improve it!

I did quite a few things! First off, Nest is currently not working, and Cubby was using a Python backend running in Nest to store website data. So, to get Cubby back up and running again, I moved the website data to a new sites.json file in the root of the repo, which is then mirrored to the website's public assets folder using a GitHub Actions workflow (I had never written one of those from scratch before!). That means no backend is necessary now.

I also sketched up some new component prototypes on Figma: I want to redesign the website because it's a) pretty lacking and b) autumn-themed (right now it is famously not autumn!). I also picked a new colour scheme and font. I'll use them in the website later<Added Ordering Form & Also did some changes in previous code˚(Hello!
This is todays devlog:


## Backend
- Implemented room capacity validation check to prevent overbooking.
- Added API endpoints for fetching and updating individual room details.

## Frontend
- **Room Management**:
  - Added "Rooms" report to view status of all rooms.
  - Implemented room editing functionality (capacity, usage status, problem reporting).
  - Updated room dropdown in student form to show capacity and free spaces.

- **Validation**:
  - Added client-side validation for student forms (Name regex, EGN length, Phone formatting).

- **Refactoring & Cleanup**:
  - Extracted inline styles from HTML files to `public/styles.css`.
  - modularized Dashboard logic into separate files in `public/js/` (`main.js`, `students.js`, `rooms.js`, `reports.js`, `navigation.js`).AStill working on stuff, debugging. More debugging. And some more.˚Êi feel insanely humbled by everything.
im trying to use astro and its a new framework ive never touched before. had to do some troubleshooting. My css skills... non existent.  it took me 30 minutes to do up a nav bar... I AM SO HORRENDOUS i will attempt to deploy this static site on github pages or something... if im done with it... LMFAO. ok. im not sure how long it will take to build this website. but i will not use AI. i will not. thanks for listening to my ted talk. it is 4am.˚ŸOMG THIS IS SOOOOO FRUSTRATING............but I finally completed my breadboard prototype for AND and OR gate, btw this is my first time using transistors so it took me quite a fair amount of time

Here are just some things to watch out for:
- Remember to put LED and resistors on the connector side, both to pull up and avoid current not flowing from the base to emitter!!!!
- Remember to put resistors for both transistors and the buttons, I just burnt two of them :(mThe CSS Is done  the background is functional just remind the JavaScript to finish the game and then Ship it.%I'm working on my first godot projectpI added code in the JS like functions and while loops
But I notice that I am able to click on the arrow buttons∂default avatars exist now due to some funny server-side stuff i did. also, the api endpoint for fetching avatars now requires the "auth" cookie so nobody but you can see your avatar!˚Added weather code to the weather widget which will soon display the type of weather it is. Also fixed the spotify widget by finishing the token refresh system. Now, if the token is expired, it will get automatically refreshed without the user needing to do anything.˚mDid a bit of research on how i could do this and found no documentation but i found 1 resource pack that already did this in worse way but it was enough for me to start and understand how i could do this and its actually pretty easy and already made a texture that when you have a diamond sword and add sharpness to it it changes the texture and ohhh its so awesomeBaseline code FINISHED! Yay!‰So I setup the requirements sort of for the project and created a navbar. I don't know why like navbar always takes lot of my time. Ig maybe because I m developing a site after a long time with this being my second siteüò≠üò≠.ëSo far today, I've built a complete login system, made some changes to the desktop system, and fixed some bugs. Just wanted to log these changes!˚~before i even started coding i needed to set up the storage. im using this on my rpi 400 (running alpine linux) for testing but it only has 16gb and im almost out so i dont want to use it for storage. i found a 64gb usb that i can use tho. i just had to figure out how to mount the new device so i could access it. after that, i just made a simple api for logging in and uploading files. Tech stack: Docker, Express.js for the backend (first time using it), Caddy, and probably React for the frontend later. the public files are served directly from Caddy and the private files are served from Express with authentication. it basically just makes a random id for the uploaded file and saves it with that id. it also saves some metadata including the original name in a json file. Heres a picture of some of my notes and the docker-compose.yml which uses the usb drive as storage with /mnt/drive˚ŒHi! This is my project that I started a long time ago, but never found the right time to polish and ship it. But... Here it is! I'm making a Minecraft mini-game called "Headwars". Just like bedwars, but different...

In the last few days I made a ton of progress, including:
- fixing some bugs,
- fixing more bugs,
- making the game ending properly,
- failing to fix fireballs >=[
- fixing bugs,
- fixing manual team assignments for players,
- testing with a friend
- fixing a bunch of bugs
- finally getting to the sweet spot with balancing store prices and resource generators, aaand
- making snowballs give a bit of knockback when hitting a player.
Oh, and... Did I tell you that I fixed some bugs too?2Look whos had a makeover.... SLAYYYY'ed i think so˚ËThe app now loads a config on startup (merges with defaults to prevent errors if its not complete), currently has 2 values: default-sort and default-theme which defines what sorting type and theme to use at startup
The app now also loads themes from a config which adds the 2 default themes if the file is empty or doesnt exist: Modern and Modern (Light), yes its the same themes as before, but now in a config!
I plan on adding config options for all new features added moving forward.NI now have a very basic display of the data stored about the blahaj in the db!åI made ropes. You can climb them when you press up when you're next to a rope. I added a circle cast to check for ropes in a certain radius.˚ëUsing scikit-learn, i trained.a random forest model on the dataset i made previously. By giving it data of 'perfect' and 'imperfect' technique, this allows the ai what good technique is. From the 127 rows of data i fed it, the ai focuses mostly on the right knee, characterising that as the most important value. 
Currently, with my very limited and possibly incorrect dataset the ai has achieved a 96.15% accuracy, however this is only for testing purposes, when my project advances, i will provide the program with more accurate data.

I am also working on a function that will allow me to scrape images of good technique from the web, allowing me to train the model on data without having to collect it manually.

After it is trained, the model is saved as a pkl file in the project folder, ready to be accessed by the executer program that allows the project to tell you if your technique is good or not.„OK I finally began my journey towards building a fully functional CPU!!!!!
First up ADDER:
- A design that can add two numbers
- How binary is used
- How logic gates are built are used, including AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR˚ÈIn this session, I added a Daily Study Goal feature to my project Student Productivity Hub. Users can now set a study goal in minutes, and the app tracks their progress based on recorded study sessions. I implemented a progress bar and status text that update automatically as new study sessions are added.

To build this, I worked with JavaScript arrays, calculations using minutes and seconds, and localStorage to persist the goal and progress across page refreshes. I also debugged issues related to data types stored in localStorage and ensured the goal logic updates correctly when the timer is stopped.

This helped me better understand state management, data persistence, and connecting multiple features together in a single web app.&Also, this isnt my actual project lmaoñJust Finished up the Competition section and added in a few hyperlinks so its more interactive also fixed up the header and footer so they look betterBwoo placeholder devlog

im making a 3d animation library btw : Pzit just puts the app inside of a desktop app for now! but it works :)

maybe next an overlay? or utilities? let me know!íI included the two needed libraries, then created two variables for temperature and humidity. I also implemented the .html-code for the webserver.˚ŸDay2! I did more important things today like changing entering the mini games from clicking on the placeholder food icons, to clicking on the entries of the recipe book, speaking of. I made an actual sprite for it and changed its size to not take up so much room. I also made it so that customers now walk in and walk out. I also added 2 more mini games todat! 2 more than yesterday. I added the coffee minigame where you have to break the full korean word down into the little grains. and I made the game game where you have to click the correct hangul characters (cake toppings) in order to form the word (cake). I also added Won and gaining of it, and I added a day / time system that currently remains unused. Anyways cya :D.|I started to learn MicroPython, and I am only making the devlog rn cuz i have to take a break. Soon I will make a part list.|I started to learn MicroPython, and I am only making the devlog rn cuz i have to take a break.

What's done:
- Navbar (Practically, there are some slight alignment issues)
- Title Screen Animations
- Some Alignment on the front

Todo:
- More content
- Projects page
- Blog Link (shouldn't be hard at all... just kinda lazy :b)
- Improve SEO
- Deployment
- File Cleanup
- ResponsivenessüMy second devlog! I worked on my 1.0 version of this game, hope u like it! You can request features to add in comments, becouse i dont know what to add next :)˚&Script to use the SMTP server for hack club account login has been updated to also do signups so now I've uhhh created uhhhh... let's just say "a few" new users while testing

Anyway soon I'll automate creating a bunch of these and store their tokens in a file so i can do fun stuff with themÓ### It's my birthday today! :D

To celebrate, I've pushed my **first deployment release** of Terminal93 - it's now playable not just in your terminal, but **in your browser as well!!**

Try it out now at https://terminal93.fly.dev/ :)added some css>Switched to a "Glassy" UI and a custom image from the internet:the watchOS app, a sketch only, syncing is not working yettIdk what i really did, i rewrote the readme, and i made the dots at the background move with the pan of the pan tool/i am working on a car with arduinoooooooooooooo˚Custom Categories!

this was a feature i really wanted since all the other apps that help you play imposter either doesnt have custom catagories or make you pay for them which is kind of annoying so i implemented custom catagories, this kinda took a while to make but i think it ended up okay, still a few more final bugs to fix but overall the bulk of the features are implementedÍBro u gotta trust me when I say I didnt actually focus on this project :/

JUst some basic code which I will change.
ALSO an output video is attached which shows the first stage of development

(code not updated in github :I sry)]The core fighting loop is ready!
Slimes are no longer just standing there!
They drop items!This is cool˚@Minor Update v0.2
Honestly, not much progress, BUT I did lay the foundation for the next day of development.
Added a bit of spicy colorful text, and a bland startmenu(will improve dw)
WAs EXTREMELY tired today and didnt code for too long, However I managed to do a very small amount. (Also code is updated in github!)‹created an entirely new (pain in the head to produce) interface system so that new cool things can be added with ease :D
this includes improvement to the speech bubble interface and positioning

this one hurt to make.˚ˆDEVLOG #2

Today I worked on one of the core pillars of Case Closed: talking to suspects and deciding who you think did it.

I implemented an Interview System that supports:
‚Ä¢ Audio playback for dialogue
‚Ä¢ Subtitle support (not wired up yet, but ready)
‚Ä¢ Multiple interview options, letting players steer the conversation

On top of that, I added the Convict Slot ‚Äî a dedicated place where you drag the suspect card you believe is guilty. This ties the investigation board directly into the act of accusation and makes the player‚Äôs conclusion feel intentional rather than automatic.

The foundation is now there for branching interviews, misleading statements, and consequences based on who you choose to trust.

More updates soon üëÄ™Monomarket is now officially finished! I‚Äôve fixed the last couple of bugs I could find and made the GitHub and website public. 
I‚Äôm excited to ship the project soon!˙Hello, everybody! Today wrote the base code. I encountered a few problems while working with new libraries. Mainly with argparse due to me using a 6 year old tutorial. But I now have a good working code for accepting user arguments from command line.˚8Whoops so much time went without devloging well at least i was only working on 1 thing which was the blog system! Which i got working after well about 10 hours because i first tried to make a version all by my self and i was getting very lost many times but then i remembered that haxmas  day 11 had a guide on how to make a blog website and i took lots of inspo but also deleted many many uneeded lines even with the guide it was hard because maybe half or more of the code was still mine the guide only gave me a foundation which was really helpfull and now i have a system where i can just create a new .md file with a frontmatter and then the content and it will atomaticly add it to the /blog page and in the homepage and oh my god its sooo good but my folder and file structure not so much i really need to clean it upﬁMore work on the case. Need to make the airflow cutout for the back and then I can move to the front panel.

Using MediaPipe, the program finds landmark points on the body in 3d space (ish). 

The script converts raw cooordinates into relative features. Using trigonometry to calculate the joint angles, the stance ratio with the distance between your feet and stance, center of gravity and more variables, i am able to form a dataset. 

Then with manual labelling (by pressing 'P' or 'I') for perfect or inperfect, it writes a row to the dataset. 
Now i will be working on using the dataset to train the AI to detect the quality of a stance. :)sSo far i have added an envoirement to work with Pi Pico and i have thinked about how i want to conquer this projectAdd Email AuthAdded unlockable items˚wYep, you caught me slacking :/

I have made little to no progress on the myRenzo project as of now, I am actually focusing on the Hangman CLI Game (Python) as it is an easy project that I started and can finish quickly so that I can properly focus on these demanding projects.

# Changes
---
- [47f712d](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/47f712d264ed41392ca4d39dc250a8a86df824e4): Little bit of work on the HTML spec.
- [a849fb1](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/a849fb18d0ebdc6a48645db900fd8c54df79557e): I was trying to implement the URL specification but turns out I need to implement a host spec and for that I need to implement IPv4, IPv6 and a couple other things. So I've implemented IPv6, but this devlog has been mostly just busy work that doesn't have much immediate benefit to the project.
---
# Next Steps
---
1. IPv4, opaque and domain parsing (basically, finish up host parsing as a whole)
2. URL parsing (I need to finish host parsing for this).Switched to a red ui andmore fluent animationsAdded Math ToC 2024 examuI'm working on my first project!"E-Book keychain" This is so exciting.

You can customize the login and plug it with a Ratatui App.
A hosted demo will be available in the future.ÜAdded the main video in my website. It animates with scroll and just looks amazing.  Next i am going to work on the cocktails section.˚«Hello there, 
today i created the drop mechanic, in this example i wanted (to test the basics) that if a item touches the drop item (in this case a element of a different project of me), it should change its graphic to a specified graphic.

as it turned out does this work pretty well, in the future i want to make it as well so, that the drop element know all the objects inside it and can if wanted give them back.

i hope you like this short little improvement.

sadly my friend (the designer) dosnt have anytime why ever, so we arent improving in visuals, which is harder for me as i am progamming orientatet to pre existing graphics. hope you understand what i mean.

but it just can get better :)˚#Displaying the CPU info was pretty annoying, mainly because the way I implemented my GlowImage widget broke the border as soon as it was in a layout. I was able to fix it after using contents margin to declare that some space in the widget is used for decorations (the border), and in the process created some debug tools which will probably be useful for as long as I work on this.  

I also took way too long to center everything vertically and horizontally, mainly because I didn't realize that BoxLayouts like to use all the space if you don't add stretch explicitly. Displaying the actual info on screen was relatively easy since I could just use QLabels in a VBoxLayout. 

Next up is probably some styling to make the UI a bit better looking, along with fetching some more CPU info to display.lTried to optimize database and added a new table. Will probably migrate to Redis for a faster database next.>Switch to a green interface and added puzzle solving detection'I've added another math exam (Toc 2016)˚8I have found a way to create a real camera view with a vanilla client.

The drone uses a LiDAR sensor to map the tree structure and locate fruits accurately. Based on this mapping, the system estimates the fruit position and plans a safe picking path.

A servo-mounted harvesting mechanism extends from the drone to gently pluck the fruit without direct contact with branches. Our research phase is complete, and the hardware development is around 50% finished. The drone is currently capable of stable flight.

The harvesting mechanism integration and autonomous picking logic are under development and will be implemented in the next phase.ZAdded switchable tabs and changed the tab design back to icons.

TRABALHEI EM ALGUMAS COISAS MAS ESQUECI DE GRAVAR O PROGRESSO. √â MAIS OU MENOS ISSO QUE FIZ. 
# Usei o Gemini CLI para me dar me guiar e ir desenvolvendo as coisas enquanto organizava.
 
O que foi realizado hoje:
Configura√ß√£o inicial e documenta√ß√£o ( a673d30):

Ajustei a base do projeto, garantindo que tanto o backend quanto o frontend estejam funcionando em harmonia.
Atualizei o README.mdpara incluir:

During this time I improved upon the add command to post more detail of the project when being added, I made changes to the Dockerfile to improve its build times using docker's cache mounts and removing unnecessary stages (i stole the build file from buns website and its very over complicated for this) and I made pending review after ship message more clear and once reviewed message more clear.“/sfx and /suggest commands are working now!
/sfx allows the user to check and listen to all the available default sound effects, and /suggest allows someone to report bugs, suggest improvements, feedback, etc!˚˝Today I finished integrating all core features of Student Productivity Hub. I fixed JavaScript errors caused by mismatched element IDs, which were breaking the study history and dark mode. After debugging with the browser console, I successfully implemented a working study timer, task list, persistent study history using localStorage, and a dark mode toggle that saves user preference. This session helped me understand how JavaScript interacts with the DOM and how small mistakes can affect the entire app.˚vFinal Draft!!!
I‚Äôm wrapping up RegexLab with this update.
The tool now supports shareable links, so the text and regex pattern are synced directly to the URL. Opening the link restores the exact same state, which makes it easy to share examples or edge cases without any setup.
I also polished the UI and interactions so it feels smoother to use overall. Highlighting is clearer, the layout is more intentional, and everything runs fully in the browser without any backend.
RegexLab does what I wanted it to do, make regex easier to test, understand, and share. I‚Äôm locking this project here and moving on to the next one.PI added cute cat and made css better.

I added a small regex library with commonly used patterns that can be inserted with a single click. This makes it easier to experiment without having to remember or type patterns from scratch.
Once a pattern is selected, everything else still works as before, matches are highlighted and the explanation updates automatically. It already feels much smoother to use compared to earlier drafts.
The final draft will focus on polishing the UI and making patterns shareable. Lessgooo˚6## Refactored codebase

I've refactored the unholy spaghetti that is my codebase. That's all I have to update.
I've attempted to include 2 videos in the last devlog, but for some reason it only shows 1 (and it's dulplicated, i am so confused), so I've squeezed out an extra devlog just to upload that video.˚≥First question after the first log: ‚ÄúHow do I keep every component in sync without prop drilling?‚Äù I hit a state-staleness bug: edits and creates updated local state but didn‚Äôt reflect across components. The fix was to lift the hook into a single source of truth‚ÄîSnippetsContext‚Äîso useSnippets became a shared provider (SnippetsContext.tsx). Problem solved: list, editor and form now see the same data instantly.

Then I improved UX: replaced textarea with Monaco in the form (SnippetForm) so creation/editing gets full syntax highlighting; added in-place editing in SnippetEditor (toggle to switch read-only ‚Üí edit). I also wired the form to return the saved snippet ID so the parent can auto-select it after create/update.

Filtering & search became richer with a useSnippetFilters layer: query, tags, language, favorites and sorting. SnippetList now renders filtered results and shows proper empty/loading states.

Finally: import/export JSON, keyboard shortcuts, sonner toasts for feedback, and robust localStorage utilities for persistence. From hook to context to full Monaco-powered editor‚Äîsnippets feel instantaneous and polished. What‚Äôs next? Export presets or cloud sync?Added some kawaii stuff...˚?Hello, I just created my bot on slack api website and added all the secrets to the .env file. Init npm and git there and download dotenv package to use those variables through process.env , Now let me read some docs and start to code!!!- 3minutes
FT didnt let me post so let me start some code 
---
Now, i got to know that i need to add some scopes before my bot can be coded so i added like chat:write and commands.

I also installed @slack/bolt module. Looks like it is the main thing and i dont need to send api requests again and again

I installed the bot in hack-club, now i got the bot token and added it in env.

Imported App class from slack lib and made a new App which i put the env variales into.

the guide said that i had to create a function and execute the server for bot to run on
and created it and hosted on port 3000.

Now I had successfully run the server but now the bot needed to connect to me so we enabled a thing called socket mode and changed a code a little bit also added a app_token with 2 scopes.

ANd now i ran the code to see what happen.˚7Day 1 ‚Äì Idea & Design

Started with the idea of creating a modern glassmorphism UI using a full-screen video background. Designed the login page layout with a floating glass card and smooth typography for a premium look.

Day 2 ‚Äì Login & Navigation

Built a demo login system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Added fixed credentials (User ID: Prince, Password: 1234) and implemented page navigation from login to dashboard.

Day 3 ‚Äì Dashboard & Profile

Created the dashboard layout with a sidebar and interactive elements. Designed a separate profile page featuring an avatar card, skill progress bars, and social/email icons to enhance personalization.

Day 4 ‚Äì Performance & Hosting

Faced issues with large video files on GitHub. Solved this by hosting videos externally and loading them via direct URLs, improving performance and keeping the repository lightweight.

Day 5 ‚Äì UI Polish & Final Touches

Refined animations, spacing, and responsiveness. Ensured smooth transitions, clean UI flow, and proper logout navigation back to the login page. Final testing focused on usability and visual consistency.

üîö Final Outcome

A lightweight, responsive frontend web app showcasing glassmorphism design, smooth navigation, and creative UI decisions ‚Äî built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.ıI added an ambulance that sometimes drives across the bottom of the screen. You can see the ambulance in the screenshot.
I made this because someone from my family said: fireworks are dangerous, so there needs to be an ambulance to help people.˚AIt is up and deployed.
Though the backend is a bit rough around the edges, it is still the best project i have ever made.
I created tye frontend using react, the backend ( the processing) was plain python and uses gemini api to analyze tye lyrics and then flask creates an api for the backend that the react app can use)Setup colour pallet, some fixes and stuff˚After the first functional prototype of the game (as in you could buy flour, bake something, and sell it), it was basically a glorified finance calculator with emojis. Since then, I have coded some major changes, so it has gone into making it feel less like clicking through menus and more like running around inside your own tiny business. The pre‚Äëoperation phase evolved from a simple setup screen into an actual space you move through, with decisions about location, style, and starting choices that actually change how your bakery plays. Instead of just ‚Äúnext, next, next,‚Äù you‚Äôre asked to think like an owner: where you set up, what kind of vibe you‚Äôre going for, and how risky or safe you want to start out.

On the numbers side, the game leveled up from basic profit/loss into a small financial lab. I wired in a proper economic simulation so things like ingredient prices, demand, seasons, and random events can actually mess with your plan (in a good way). A dedicated finance dashboard with charts lets you see trends over time instead of just a single ‚Äúyou made X coins‚Äù message‚Äîso you can spot when your costs are creeping up or your margins are getting squeezed. Inventory and spoilage started getting more realistic too, so baking too much or storing stuff forever actually hurts, and smart planning starts to matter. All of that was about turning the game from ‚Äúclick to bake‚Äù into ‚Äúexperiment with real business concepts and see what happens,‚Äù without losing the fun of running your own digital bakery.]Hellooooo. I after some help am now able to change the order of the options order repeatedly. bug fixes. project is about done˚·## Implemented server!
I've implemented a simple server! It's using WebSocket because I'd like to provide a web demo in the future, and WebSocket is perfect for that. Also, I'll be able to host dedicated servers in addition to LAN P2P with the same codebase, which is a nice bonus.

I've also (embarrassingly) attached my tetr.io gameplay clip instead of my project in the last devlog (when can we get the ability to edit devlogs btw), so I've attached it to this one. Sorry! :PüYesterday i made the screen work, I also added the functionality to enter API keys and select your API - chatgpt gemini and ollama (only gemini is tested yet).]Got inspired by a few professional websites, and improved the styling and css of the website.˚dealt with some annoying fucking bullshit, now im just trying to make the readme. its very heavily inspired by https://github.com/TodePond/GulfOfMexico (formerly known as Dreamberd). one of the bugs i had was a statement being parsed differently depending on how many variable declarations were next to it, like if you had [var decl] [very buggy struct decl] [var decl] then it wouldnt parse correctly, but changing the var decls to any other statement would make it work and getting rid of either var decl also fixed it. bullshitcToday i worked on making the first bit look nicer and cleaner and this was what my efforst produced˚I‚Äôm developing a web application using a CNN-based deep learning model to recognize Indonesian spices. You just upload an image, and it tells you which spice it is‚Äîmaking it easier for people worldwide to learn and identify Indonesian spices quickly and accuratelyèthere's now a session tracker page so you can see the devices that you're logged into! in production "::1" would be an actual public IP addressÉI worked for the past 2 days on the start of my portfolio. It will have a cosmic theme and hopefully people will visit the website.rWorked on finishing MCU schematic, and trying to route stuff on the PCB. Especially the debug port (not JTAG, SWD)9Added a new webring, a favicon and fixed a few (ten) bugs$Added instructions to the help menu!˚>I added the functionality to download the CSV file and filter through the rows to find the one which contains the location data for the provided IP address. Currently, the code only provides the exact data from the CSV file, which contains the ISO 3166 codes for the country and region as well as the name of the city.ifix book upload and fix search bar tags parse error.
let owner edit tags and make cover upload function.7So far learnt (revised) the basics, JSX, API and Hooks.˚N# Devlog 10: Cargo Rockets
I added cargo rockets, which allow you to transport items between planets. These are inspired by Galacticraft's cargo rockets and can be completely automated. They load chunks around them, so there is no need for a player nearby. After setting their target in the GUI, you can launch them by powering a nearby Cargo Launch Controller. A nearby cargo rocket can also be detected using a Cargo Rocket Detector. The Cargo Manager allows for hoppers to directly interface with a nearby cargo rocket. I also made some minor changes in preparation for the new planets.Xbug fix for ::before pseudo element and dock restyling with bounce animation and new svg?App can now find another neighbor computer in the local networkÀI started planning my project. 
This involved defining my prior knowledge and interests to hone in on a specific goal -- what do I actually want it to do? What am I able to do? What do I want to create?˚"more untested code! to be tested tomorrow

(it's like an event loop or something. i am coming to the realization that i will somehow need to write developer documentation for all of this)

in other news I turned full line code completion back on, we'll see if it actually saves any time“I added a few new files, integrated socket.io into a server, and built a basic desktop template for further use using interact.js. Not much is currently functional, though. I will continue development tomorrow.˚]This is Draft 3. In this draft, I added basic explanations for common regex patterns.
Along with match highlighting, RegexLab now shows a plain-language breakdown of what different parts of a regex are doing. The explanations are rule-based and currently cover only the most commonly used tokens, which keeps things understandable and predictable.
This already makes it easier to reason about why a pattern behaves the way it does, instead of treating regex like a black box.
Next, I want to focus on usability by adding a small library of common regex patterns that can be quickly inserted and tested.˚]This is Draft 3. In this draft, I added basic explanations for common regex patterns.

I implemented a study timer with Start and Stop controls and fixed issues related to JavaScript loading and event handling. I also added a task list feature that allows users to dynamically add tasks.

While styling the app, I debugged CSS linking issues and improved the layout. I implemented a dark mode toggle and fixed contrast problems, then enhanced it by saving the user‚Äôs theme preference using localStorage so it persists after page refresh.

This session helped me learn debugging, DOM manipulation, CSS styling, and basic state persistence in JavaScript.˚0Spent a bunch of time debugging weird issues with turborepo, and getting convex to work properly with better-auth (https://labs.convex.dev/better-auth/features/local-install)
Starting to think I should have gone with what i'm usually used to working with (postgres), or using something like clerk/workos9Made the second section fluid responsive and animated it!˚∑Spent ~4 hours pushing NeoDrone V1 forward in KiCad. Set up the project with hierarchical sheets (power, MCU, RC, IMU, motor/ESC) and started wiring the logic. Tuned the MCU power rails with proper decoupling (100 nF all over, plus 1 uF bulk) and laid out the center stack on the quad-shaped PCB outline. Locked in the TI MCF8316A FOC driver choice, built its schematic symbol, and had to design my own footprint from scratch. Kinda cursedíwe have walking animations for my silly for left and right we also now have the right idol kinda choppy but whatever (right walk sprites attached)˚## Garbage system!

I've implemented a garbage system (hopefully) identical to guideline Tetris! I've also implemented a "Backfire" mode where you basically attack yourself with a 0.5x multiplier. That way I can show this demo.

I think I'll now begin working on multiplayer :D.simulate projectile motion with air resistance.simulate projectile motion with air resistancethis is my project~! Ok I have Projectile motion finally done since this was the first one it took so loong I also finished attawood machine sorry I forgot the last devlog, welp time to worrk throught the night agian!!!!```Backend API addedII added a streak and an image sharing feature.

My performance below :P˚fI started working on fetching location data from IP addresses in the APNIC (Asia Pacific) registry. Currently you can look an IP up and it will find the internet provider, as well as providing the URL for the geofeed.csv file which contains the locations for all IP ranges from that provider.

(Don't worry the IP i'm using in the screenshot is from a VPN)˚1features added:

- üëÅÔ∏è **Stealth Mode**: Invisible to most screen capture/sharing tools (Zoom, Discord, browsers)
- ‚ö° **One-Key Answers**: Capture questions via screenshot and get AI-generated solutions instantly
- üîß **Conversational Debugging**: Send error screenshots for intelligent troubleshooting
- üé® **Multi-Language Support**: Generates code in various programming languages plus HTML/CSS from design screenshots
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Global Shortcuts**: Control everything with undetectable keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+D for quick answers)
- üîí **Privacy-First**: All data stays local; only API calls use your personal Groq API key

Built with **Electron + React + TypeScript**, it's completely customizable and free from subscriptions‚Äîyou only pay for your own API usage.  Licensed under AGPL-3.0.˚%The subscriptions tab for Subtrack is almost complete! In this update, I added different categories for the services so it's easier to browse and filter specific categories while adding a new subscription or when viewing and filtering all your subscriptions with category tags. This makes it a lot easier to manage your subscriptions by category and sort them effectively. Also added a renewal date option so you can select when the subscription is going to renew as a reminder. The app automatically calculates the next renewal date based on subscription duration and current time with helpful renewal notifications that will hopefully get implemented in the future! Updated the data structure, cleaned up redundant code, refactored some inefficiencies, fixed some more bugs, and updated styling as well.{built the base , lots of refining to do , currently the ui looks bad, im hoping to do some improvements in that department.taccount creation and logging in work
i keep remaking and tearing down the oauth system because i wanna get it right˚¶So, pretty substantial update since last time (I think), I added the healthbar that I promised to add last time, the main menu and the lose screen, debugged some things. Now, what I should do is make the damaging system better so any comments on how to make the damage seem fair let me know. Also I plan to add waves, which I dont really know how I will tackle right now but I'll figure something out. See you next devlog!nUpdated the package to v1.0.1 and now it links to a stable release on github. I dont want it rejected anymore.˚¿I started out with just doing some testing messing around with ai.hackclub.com to test if it could work with my intended usecase, and it seems like it does! For this flashcard app, I want to have the mode where users can see a term and type the definition, and have it be checked by AI! Traditionally, this is a paid feature, and should be super helpful for topics in the sciences or history. (In the screenshot, I tested it with "13th ammendment")˚ÈI was able to get movement fixed so the program now reconizes wich of the eight directions the player moves in. sadly that means i have to animate 8 difrents sprites woe is me. I am very happy with the progress and somewhat mad that its inability to switch was a minor spelling error. I also was able to make the placement walls colliadable (i think thats the word) so the player cant walk through em now yippeeee (new added code pictured bellow yep i used a lot of if else statements TwT)]Im so done with this but it was mostly finished!!! I will ship this right after some clean-up˚I spent a good while getting the team data from the api onto the site into a nicely formatted table. After that I decided to work on the alliance selection section that allows the user to lay out all of their alliances. I plan on changing the sizing of things but yeah :D˚vI came up with a final design which uses the elliptical wings and a mid-body hook fuselage (the hook is in the middle section of the fuselage), The wing is to be made of 2x 2.5mm balsa wood sheets stacked together on top and the fuselage is to be made of a single layer 6mm balsa wood sheet, The tail of the aircraft is to be made of a single layer of 2.5mm balsa wood sheet!Added onto the art for my website=Added searching! searches filenames but also folders and tags˚†I have decided to put the wheels inside the robot instead of outside so that they are protected, and the robot looks more aesthetically pleasing.
To support multiple drive modes, the plan is to have a system where you can change the front plate of the robot to accommodate different types of steering at the front (will probably support only Ackermann and normal for now). One of the plates will have two circular holes for the two steerable wheels, and another will have two rectangular holes for non-steerable wheels (in differential and mecanum drive). This system will also include different motors and mounts that will steer/rotate the wheels and keep them in place.SJust started the project lol. Kinda nervous where this project will even get me to.˙Here's a bit of a wild feature... **IRC-style live chat!!**

I've created a chat app which connects to [Trollbox](https://www.windows93.net/#!trollbox), and lets you talk with other random people on the internet. I'll probably regret this some day.˚oArbitrary precision libraries implemented. Now technically there is infinite zoom for the viewer. If you have it on, you could technically zoom in forever albeit it will get very slow very quickly. 

The effective limit for this program used to be a zoom of e+16 because thats where long double precision ends, but GMP extends this technically indefinitely I think...

There are a lot of issues with optimization and performance though, after zoom exceeds e+30 the program starts taking up like 700%+ of my macs cpu usage and ends up taking ~30-40 seconds to render one screen. I'll see what I can do to make it better.˚ËI got collision to work!!!!!! After fighting with my terrible pixel ‚Üí meter & meter ‚Üí pixel conversion code, I finally got object-surface collision working. I started adding friction as well. Once friction works, I'm planning on trying to allow for sloped surfaces and rigid body tilts. I might take a break from normal Newtonian physics and try some space physics (or maybe fluid dynamics :0). I still need to decide if I want to make this into a physics library or just a simulator.ÖCreated a password hash encryption feature that automatically saves encrypted passwords to the database so that it is securely stored∏worked on the tunneling system, and came up with the name town, it can tunnel http files, crrently its all local so this is just useda n example but the client side is sort of working.˚cI added oauth using our schools intranet, a whitelist for memebers of the team, set up all the reusable components and color scheme. The tech stack is sveltekit and tailwind css. I worked on a dashboard and also in the database added all the tables that I will need later on. I also worked on the GUI for the test selector and for part of the test parser.âThe sprites have been uploaded to VS Code, and now all that's left is to make a few final adjustments before making the game multiplayer.˚=Today, I decided to do math to figure out the mass, wing loading and launch velocity, All the math I did is most likely highly theoretical however, I was able to finalize my specs for this, I have decided to aim for 70 grams of mass with a wing area of 400cm and a aspect ratio or 1:6.25, This should give me a excellent amount of momentum and penetration power after launch.

The launch force is stipulated to be 4kgf or 32.9 joules

A lot of this math is way of as I am not accounting for everything hence I only real world tests will be able to give me accurate dataﬁWelcome! I've been thinking about creating some sort of pizza tycoon game, and this is where we begin! For now, I'm going to reuse the sprite from my previous game as a placeholder, and I've currently got movement working!)Added pages for viewing images or videos!yI add english support and add some notes. Reviewer only can use it by running the python file!!! It needs backed server!!Added a title on the game page˚’Wow... That's a lot! I've added file transfers, which comes with chunking and I've also added encryption! Also fixed a few bugs there and there :) Also tested the file transfer feature with a 1.5GB video file (you can see it in the ss). Obsidian is *usable* while transferring it, although I may move the transfer to another thread in the future to make the performance even better. Next, I'll be working on refining the current implementation and then adding realtime.XCreated a virtual tree and also a bunch of functions for connecting to the Hackatime api˚I have the wires hooked up, a little bit confusing because I forgot where to connect leds, but I did it. Now my last thing is coding, I can do the code but I would like some tips, if you guys have any tips for arduino coding which is C++ I would appriciate it thanks!I'm working on this now! I'm going to start with srpc, an RPC framework for server-driven Rust apps. I'll keep posting as I go!ÉSet up the basic file management UI! You can upload files and view them. It needs a lot more work on styling and features, but yeahSprites completed˚sI did a pretty nice cleanup pass on the art pages this update. I switched the gallery images over to WebP for better performance, which was actually an idea suggested by a commenter, so big thanks for that! üôè The galleries now load lighter images, but the modal still pulls up the original PNG/JPEG versions so nothing is lost quality-wise. Also fixed some HTML structure issues on the Art III Painting page (including an embarrassing body tag typo i didn't even notice), cleaned up the layout, and improved the modal behavior so it locks scrolling properly and closes more reliably. Overall things should feel smoother now.˚yI finally got Fable Friend out of the terminal and into a web interface! Now there is a clean chatbot-like web UI for interacting with it. Now I can get back to modifying the original logic flow and continuing improving it. My biggest focus next is making sure it does not dwell on the initial situation too much and move on. Gradio was actually exactly what I was looking for.˚I've finished training the model on the data. I used the Logistic Regression model, which is often used for predicting binary outcomes (like having or not having heart disease). Next, I want to make a UI for patients to enter their health inputs and see the model's predictions.˚lUsing mediapipe, i made a program that finds the position of body joints, joining them up to create a pipe frame of the limbs. From this, i calculated the angles of each arm and leg, this way i was able to detect the position of the body and correct the stance. i decided on trying to first code a still position, the Gedan Barai (downward block). I chose this because it is relatively simple stance and it had leg and arm positions that could be detected mostly through arm and leg angles. I improved on my original detection by using 3d vectors to try to more accurately find the positioning of limbs (results varied). Finally, i added a simple system, in which the colour of the joints shown turn from red to green, in response to the correctness of the positioning and a timing system, that allows you to see how long you hold your correct stance in.


Tomorrow i hope to add more stances, and work on the accuracy of the data as well as adding new variables, such as foot positioning and hip position. :)
I spent a lot of time researching different ways to make this project work, i will try using YOLO for positioning too.˚ƒI setup the CollisionManager class to hold a list of all the rigid bodies and surfaces, and detect collision. I currently have an AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) overlap check to detect when rectangles overlap. I will improve this later so rigid bodies can rotate. I updated the physics calculation to scale correctly to pixels. I also added a material system to store restitution and friction. I left a nod to my physics teacher (CHUCK_D_CUBEEEEEEE).˚áI've written code to read and process the data. I used an open source dataset from the IEEE DataPort website, which combined 5 pre-existing heart disease datasets (cited below). The values were already sorted out nicely, so I didn't need to account for NaN or non-numerics. 

Manu Siddhartha, "Heart Disease Dataset (Comprehensive)", IEEE Dataport, November 5, 2020, doi:10.21227/dz4t-cm36qNow uses Bolt and Socket Mode! I added '/woof' and auto reaction (with :woofwoof) when 'woof' is sent in channel!˚{- Moved the font into a header since it is just the definitions now.
- Moved the set_backlight into the screen class, rather than just laying about.
- Modified my build script to flash with openocd and a pico probe. You may be able to see it attached to the back of the sprig if you look closely - it doesn't add any functionality, just allows for quicker firmware uploads and debugging.
- Added a small script which uses ffmpeg to convert image files into the BGR565 format which is what is required for the sprig screen.
- Got the SD card interface built into the screen working with fat32 - the sprig can now read and write to any external storage connected here. This is what I spent most of my time working on, since it DID NOT want to cooperate.
- Added an interface for the speaker - just playing sine waves for now (like the spade implementation of the sprig, used for the games made on the website). This also took a larger amount of time, but nowhere near the time for the SD card.

In the video, you can see a demo of the audio beep and the SD card detection. Note that the hackclub logo is being read from the SD card, it is not stored on the device. This is why it requires that the user insert an SD card.

Since I received a PicoWH with my sprig (was that intended?), next I will add an option to automatically download and populate the SD card inserted if not already populated.˚qThis is the first devlog for Case Closed! Today I started building the core systems for the game:

‚Ä¢ Investigation Board System ‚Äì where all clues, suspects, and locations are tracked.‚Ä¢ 
‚Ä¢ Card System ‚Äì with different card types: Generic Clue, Location, and Suspect.
‚Ä¢ Location Switching ‚Äì inspecting a Location card now spawns you there so you can find more clues.
‚Ä¢ Clue Objects ‚Äì interactable objects in locations that lead to additional hints.

This is just the beginning, and there‚Äôs still a lot more to build. If you like what you see, follow the project to stay updated on future progress! :DÛOh right we need to devlog- well hi! I've been doing the database stuff for now and mostly just... Thinking of what data I can put in a single profile; asked in my personal channel and got some ideas from Suya too: Here are the fields for now!˚Sorry I haven't been posting any devlogs!!!!!!!! I promise I've been working :sob:
I have a basic Object/Context model working for the library, and some window stuff
Working on building out the Window class rn

image is a (very) rough draft of the mascot˚çThis is Draft 2 of RegexLab. In this draft, I focused on making regex behavior visible instead of abstract.
RegexLab now highlights all matches directly inside the text, so instead of just seeing a yes or no, you can actually see what parts of the input the pattern is matching. The text input stays editable, and a separate preview updates in real time with highlighted matches.
This already makes debugging patterns a lot easier, especially when a regex matches more than once or behaves unexpectedly.
Next, I want to move beyond visuals and start explaining regex patterns in plain language so it‚Äôs clearer why a pattern behaves the way it does.pImplemented JWT session token implementation via supabase, because apparently python doesn't store it for you :(session logging is now a thing˚@Hello,
Today I added the students add page and the view of them
also I made all the tables for the database and make the project structure.
The design is so ahh, but eventually I will make it.

I integrated google translate because my program is in Bulgarian, because the program will actually be used in my school./added missing tabs (settings and notifications),Finishing up the sprites (still a lot to do)0Updated some links, styling, added some buttons.snake is now fully playable!‘Changed the backend due to the old one not supporting bluetooth. I've also updated the UI, but I still have more to update about it to make it less jarring.

- [f351b9c](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/f351b9c6e19c376b1e8717fbf358cfee27176126): I moved from calling DNS resolution functions independently to having a DNS resolver which caches resolved addresses and does cache invalidation after a TTL is elapsed.
- [d443140](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/d44314071338ed6abc03669970cd9899fe42b008): Added automatic redirect following, so responses with status code 3XX automatically trigger a redirect check
- [abea778](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/abea778603a7689d80c3ba759bf54f1142d909f4): Started work on the HTML stuff by adding some structures I saw in the [official HTML5 specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/).
---
# Next steps
---
1. Ignore most of the remaining structures/traits (*and the stuff I marked as TODO*), and go straight into the HTML parser
---
## Notes
---
Maybe trying to start with expressing the entire HTML spec in code wasn't the best idea. I don't like leaving things mid-way but I don't really see another way out here, at least for now.ÃJust made the html page chose all the fonts to use and decide how to build the page and what it should look like and what the theme is.(And also wrote down what css id's and class to use [named them too])ÃJust made the html page chose all the fonts to use and decide how to build the page and what it should look like and what the theme is.(And also wrote down what css id's and class to use [named them too])µStill having my fun with the rendering system but I'm much closer to finishing now!

TODO:
-finish it (few variables away, just need to find which :D)
-add UI and game mechanics§quick update worked on the seo and favicon final changes and then i should ship or i am probably going to work on custom catagories but this is pretty much finished˚˘While also working on the SDK I'm noticing a few errors regarding the vsock communication between the main server (the API) and the Enclave service running inside of it. Also, I've been trying to fix how the enclave handles calls to AWS KMS to generate and handle Data Encryption Keys (DEKs), so I'm trying to figure out how I can make calls like those from an isolated environment. I'm studying the official AWS Nitro Enclaves SDK (only written in,,, C üò≠) to figure out how to do the same thing in Go.˚'Started working on RegexLab, a small browser-based regex playground.

Draft 1 is focused only on the core: typing a regex, typing some text, and getting immediate feedback on whether it matches. It also handles invalid patterns so you‚Äôre not left guessing why something isn‚Äôt working.

Nothing fancy in this draft. The goal was to get a solid base working before adding any visual layers or explanations on top of it.

Next draft will focus on highlighting matches directly inside the text so it‚Äôs clearer what the regex is actually doing.˚:I've been adding more tests to the SDK and I'm trying to solve some issues related to the vsock communication between the parent application (my server) and the enclave app. Also, I've been enhancing the way errors are structured in order for users to have little to no trouble figuring out what is actually wrong.˚ØI decided that html and Flask just wouldn't work so I have switched to gradio now. At this point, I am just trying to get ANY frontend so I can get back to building more logic for Fable Friend. I might switch to another framework. Now I am just experimenting until I find something that works. In the picture I interact with a local model using a simple gradio chat interface. The question I asked smollm was "What are elephants?".˚˜Today, I‚Äôve been working on a Market Making bot specifically designed for Polymarket. My focus is on providing liquidity and capturing the spread across high-volume prediction markets.

I'm currently refining the inventory management logic and order placement frequency. Has anyone here experimented with building a MM bot on Polymarket before? I‚Äôd love to hear about your experience with the CLOB API, how you handle 'toxic flow,' or any tips on optimizing execution speed on the Polygon network.˚ˇI added a lot to both the backend and the frontend. The backend works fully with supabase and all of the data tables are set up. There is also user authentication through email, and there should be through GitHub but thats still broken. Then after the backend as done I tested it and it worked, so I mocked up a rough frontend for creating bots, editing them and their rules and evaluations, and then for playing bots against each other. Right now its only your bots, but later I'll add the multiplayer aspects.˚•Added Reveal Imposter page, it has a cool animation and it shows the word that it was there, i also worked on the word list, and a few other quality of life tweaks to make the project better. I think that this project is basically complete, but i would like to add a few more fetures like custom word lists, batter card ui, and maybe something else oh and i also need to redo the seo and stuff but its playable right now.˚7Added download options. You can now change the scale and the background color of the PNG!!
I struggled a lot trying to export the canvas scaled and am still confused about that but it works now!
I also noticed that the JetBrains Mono font had ligatures by default so I disabled that, should look better now :3ÁFinished up the Spotify player by adding in a functioning play/pause button. I also started working on the weather widget, which currently uses the Open Meteo API to fetch the current weather once you give it the name of your city.˚µToday I've added a skill for researching a topic. I based it off the research skill on Daniel Miessler's Personal AI Infrastructure project, but modified it to be compatible with OpenCode, use less tokens and have a response format that I like better. The research skill works by first generating different research angles. After that, a subagent is spawned in parallel for each research angle. Finally, the findings from each agent are combined into a research report. The result is the prompt "research everything we know about consciousness and different theories and philosophies" generating this result:
(full answer on https://gist.github.com/Mikuel210/a8589b2f922675819077e517cca3dac7)€Added castling, a special move that allows the king and rook to move simultaneously. Fixed white king and white queen being swapped (stupid mistake), now only check and checkmate remains to implement, almost finished :)ÓI locked in and created this:

- working sword animation
- slimes that you can kill (so they can you)
- cool effect

The biggest thing is that i can create or balance any item in a few seconds because of my database made in CastleDBWThe CSS Is half way done now the game background in coming together, Just give it time.~i added a guestbook! i also added some contacts to the footer. i also set a footer, knowing the user what website they are on!ûImplemented a backend for playing music. 

I'm planning on adding metadata indexing, and I also need to improve the UI to be more of the desired end result.§I downloaded some Census data to understand the format, and started drafting some Rust structs and types to figure out how to store and manipulate data efficiently.ìI found another bug... It's been three hours and I haven't been able to fix it... I'll make the sprites in Figma and then I'll try to fix it again.˚˝started with a fun idea: the plan is super easy leet code or something but with n ppl, you each have to alternate writing lines of code / characters

was first time really using typescript and next.js, so struggled through a lot of docs reading & ai assistance
used the monaco text editor (what vscode uses), and had many issues trying to initialize it through react (its a weird promise thing)
switched to svelte <3
was doing pretty well, did monaco -> get text content -> pyodide for python code execution, got a terminal down, and then wanted to add text syncing across devices
did some research, there was a library called y-monaco that used yjs to sync monaco (woah cool that that exists, so niche), and a service called partykit that could host it

set it up and then...
there were a lot of syncing issues between my friend who was helping me test and i
after some debugging, found that this was a platform specific issue (she had windows, i had mac) that was documented on the y-monaco github issues page; used a fix provided in the issue to bypass it


then came time to make the challenges. 

for [no for loops], ran into issues like people can bypass with map, and also other types of bypasses, but just settled with a simpler warning 

alternating lines was tougher so after a bit gave up

hiding worked!
quickly added some problems from project euler to see whats up‚Äîit was super fun and funny!

# Spicetown v(a)1.3[13-15]
## Added
Added Users to the users tabÆIs it binary? The answer may surprise you.

we have two different kinds of UTF-16 and you have to guess which one is correct

also JS labels are real and you Can use them1avatar uploading exists now which is pretty cool!ÉCreated a really nice TUI base with a very modular window system and added a downloader too with a nice progressbar and everything!}bugfixes:
CPU measuring not working for processes - Fixed
Cant reopen process stats window after closed with escape - Fixedfixed window paddingrI made a detector for the Improved Crash Reports mod, and got the info from it. I made some tests for that as well˚µI looked up my previous "redirect to app approach from magic link" was no good and expo router should handle some of the stuff so I made some adjustments. 
I fished making the schedule UI, added date headers to separate matches happening on different days. I also made the filtering buttons function, you can filter by past, today's and upcoming matches.
The schedule uses dummy data for now, I will have to get the data from supabase.˚sHeavily optimized the processlist by applying these changes:
1.    not deleting all processes from the list and readding a new class instance of them every update (its not necessary to delete and readd 300 identical classes every update)
2.    only deleting process gui elements that are for processes that dont exist anymore
3.    for processes that still exist, i just overwrite the old PIDs with the new ones to make sure the process isnt out of date
4.    only adding new process gui element instances for new processes that werent in the gui last update
These changes made the update so fast and smooth that you dont notice it anymore! (before it froze for a couple ms) That allowed me to now automatically update every second so you dont have to press update everytime you close a window to see the changes!
Of course i removed the update button because of the now automated updates :D
Also fixed a bug thats been here for the past few devlogs (since searching was implemented) where it adds multiple spacer items above the processlist when .removing items from the list not matching the search.
Sorry for the wall of text D:)Added analytics and updated the homepage.'Just the start, simple and nothing moreUstarted the UI work, may not look the best but UI is not my top priority right now :34Added snake class and some other stuff to go with it˚|Currently working on adding a synthwave sun to the background! It looks fire but with some BIG issues rn.

1. It's so hard to see anything in front of the sun.
2. The transition looks horrible
3. The colour matches the platform, but switches INSTANTLY instead of easing in.

This has turned out to be so much harder than I thought it would be. Looks mid rn but I'll lock in!ÆFinal fixes and upload Windows Binary for demo
If you have a VR Headset you can try it here (https://github.com/ColinVanderMeer/UntitledFishingGameGodot/releases/tag/VR-1.0)˚2Worked on the base for Gemini-Slack so now it supports you actually like uploading photos, still no context though, so i need to work on keeping the photos in context, maybe document support next, or search integration with the hackai search api, but i think the projet is doing good, lots of ideas for it.˚Worked on the game screen where you tap your name so you can see your card, looks good in my opinion i kind of like it, it brings you to the game card that i made earlier, just need to work on a good animation or something for the reveal imposter button and what that does.pIm working on hackblog, its an amazing social media for hackers (hackclubers) with boards and a neet flow to it!+fixed the issue where bridges wouldnt count˚IThis all started when I wanted to configure the Linux open command so that I could open png files in my web browser rather than the image viewing program which I did not really like. It turns out that this configuration process is convaluted and difficult and was not fun at all.

Therefore, I decided to create Pigpen, a wrapper around the open command. It is very simple because it is just a wrapper. It reads from a config file (located at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pigpen/config.txt) and decides what program to use.

In the below screenshot, you can see Pigpen in use. In the terminal window, you can see that my config has PDF's open in Zathura and image files open in Qutebrowser. I then use Pigpen to open the monkey picture and it opens in Qutebrowser, and I use Pigpen again to open a D&D character sheet and it opens in Zathura.

I made Pigpen to be super easily configured, and I am very glad with how it came out. From now on, I will have "open" aliased to "pigpen" in my bashrc so I will always use Pigpen. If you want to use it too, I will have installation instructions in the Readme.¢I got the website done over half-way with a rough mock-up of what I could think to make.
Now working on the "Generate Project Idea" area... that one will be fun!˚ÍüéÅ Secret Santa

:3\Created a pyproject.toml, built application, and added to PyPI and created a GitHub release.˚Worked on Visionary as a whole, with a focus on profiles. You can now add bios, profile pictures, see stats about your Visionary usage, get Achievements (WIP), follow users, and chat in both DMs and in the induvial project (with the ability to attach files!).%Added member management to workspaces˚For the past two hours I have been routing all the components, reducing ratlines from 200 all the way down to 20
- Connected all columns and rows
- Swapped some pins, such as moving all the column pins to the left
- Added GND vias (still more to add......îAdded new easter egg that is relevant to VR. (Note: the character normally moves much more smoothly, I just have drift on my quest controllers üò≠)˚úI started my flavortown project! I'm making a cozy cafe game. I started off by spriting a placeholder NPC and some food items, I then began coding customer requests and a neat translation backend for easy Korean translations, I also made it so you can click on each of the recipes to enter a mini-game to create the dish, the better you do in the mini-game the higher the dish satisfaction. Currently only the bread mini-game has been coded where you have to select the correct Hangul characters that mean bread. I also began creating the start of the recipe book that will contain every recipe you have unlocked, as well as translations and mastery statuses :3 :D :).random devlog]I think I'm close to be ready with this one. It's not a AAA game, but I think it isn't so bad˚yFirst of all, the first question that came up to my mind when I started this project was: "What is a code snippet?". To me, it was a block of highly reusable code, easy to maintain and scale, that I use frequently. Where should I save it without using a database? Easy, browser's local storarge. So I started by defining the schema of a snippet and the hook that I would be using for the next hour to create, update, save and delete snippets: useSnippets()
Then it was the time to develop the UI, quick shadcn components, Monaco Editor to edit and visualize the code properly, a form to create/edit snippets and that's it. Or is it?˚-I've gotten rid of the achievement placeholder widgets and the UI actually looks nice now! :D

it took me way too long to figure out how I can mangle text in order to make this look semi-decent lol (and the fact that emojis are a different width to other text characters was throwing everything off)˚Hwrote the encoder interface and methods! Most of the time was to figure out how to represent the encoder rotations. I created an 8 bit variable that tracks the old and new state. States are determined per a lookup table I constructed by creating change between [00, 01, 10, 11] by itself. The result was 16 possible outputs for which way the rotation could be. The first method I made was a static method that updated the encoder state and encoder delta. Then, I realized i forgot to initialize it (haha) so I made that and used callbacks to not have to do a while(true) polling loop.vToday I've added a skill to get context on the user from a file when needed (e.g. get the projects they're working on)I've just started recalling the basics and fundementals and am currently moving onto developing the information for the website{Created a way to fetch data from the wakatime API, and a simple pie graph that displays language data from the last 7 days.˚qadd deployment things like docker-compose and k8s deployment and fix bug that image server can't upload image and db can't be setup problems.

In addition I drew this pirate I think he looks decent and some tiles that are kinda meh i might redraw them later. Next thing to do is probably adding enemies and some gameplay. I have some rough ideas like maybe a jetpacker or machinegunner.  I still haven't figured out how each level should end so I should probably do that, but first enemies I'm thinking.local OCR with tesseract doneîAdded some CSS

# Changes
---
- [bc11bca](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/bc11bca3007d8c25a07f685b55ea57e2dbd85bd8), [076345e](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/076345eb43db650863e6010fdcf1f836057b2f7c): I added basic DNS resolution so you don't have to type in IP addresses when sending requests, and can just write a domain/hostname
- [17ad97c](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/17ad97c85290f40eeb013a48ec920f29136842ef): I abstracted streams away into a trait allowing me to implement a new kind of stream which supports TLS, which means I can now send and receive responses with HTTPS!

1. DNS caching and cache invalidation
2. Maybe some work on the rendering?†Fix the joystick working in menus and redo other controller code to use new input emulation method. Now the game is fully playable and just needs some polishingEworked on teh sliders and made everything function, except the sound.˚'You can create classes now and give assignments classes so you can filter things better now :D

# Misc changes
- Prettier calendar dates :D
- Show assignments that are due that day
- Moved related routes to their own file in the backend
- Fixed a few areas TypeScript was complaining about˚DEach process in the list now has a "More stats" button that opens a window with, you guessed it! more stats

Heres a large devlog (includes both). First two images are for devlog 1 and the last one for devlog 2
**Devlog 1**
Added data collection from HSL's MQTT Realtime API. The data is currently stored in a SQLite database. Also added npm scripts.
**Devlog 2**
Realized the database was inefficient and restructured the data.∏Implemented Gemini into my app through API where it will generate a response from the prompts and also take context from the google classroom's assignment webpage to guide the student.˚@I wouldn't say I've been too productive, but I managed to get a few things done.
This was a very short coding session nonetheless :/
Added some files and some features including:
Text To speech
Speech To text (not completed)

added some plans too! I would be happy if you guys could also demand some more features!˚For the past hour I was reading TB6612FNG schematic and trying to apply it to my own. But here were the problems:
- I wanted to supply my RP2040 through both USB (5V) and battery (12V)
- What pins should I keep and crossed out cuz I wanted it to be minimal–Working on making the adding code functional so it gets saved locally when you add it, honestly id prefer if i had a server to save them, but my only option to make this work is to make them be saved locally.ÜAdded the sword throw object and added support for the Core (Plus) Wired Controller (it might work for other controllers too, idk tho)"Compelted the main part of the ui.˚I started by learning and educating myself on how making a slack bot in python works. Currently it is sends a random message (from a list) to a certain channel when the program is run. it only works in a private channel for now while we sort out Woof as a YSWS launching.˚EI spent a brief time to set up and test an offline thing when the user doesn't want to use external APIs (like groq or OpenAI)

Nothing huge, but it works, it‚Äôs playable, and it does what I wanted it to do.

The idea was simple. I wanted to show short reports and let the user decide whether they‚Äôre valid or just vibecoded. Under the hood, it‚Äôs basic React state management randomizing data, tracking answers, calculating score, and showing a result screen.

Main focus was:
Clear game flow (start --> play --> result --> restart)
State handling
UI that feels fun instead of a "croporate-website"

I ran into small issues along the way  score bugs, undefined states, responsiveness on mobile but fixed them one by one.

It‚Äôs a small project,
On to the next drop.òAdded procedurally generated asteroids and explosions. Also added shooting, UI, end screen and a second spaceship image for when the player accelerates.<Completed the second section too! gonna animate it tommorow!‘I added the en passant move, a special move that occur when a pawn makes its initial 2-square move and ends up side by side with an opponent‚Äôs pawn, which then has the opportunity to capture it on the next turnjadded a base "profile configuration" controller (config screen coming soon:tm:)
also smol and big rock!!! Added 2nd stage of the tutorial!£hello world! i added a simple message listener just to make sure our bot works. there was something wrong the bot's permission so i configured it and it works now!nI've added the first exam. Math Toc 2019 to the website. It took a lot of time because I wrote it using LaTeX.'Serverless functions are almost done...:))´I have completely restructured the item database. Now I don't have to hardcode every item by myself.
Also you can see what you are holding right now (maybe remove later).˚ÚI set up the backbone of the engine. I coded a Vec2 struct that can do the needed vector math (+, -, *, /, dot product, etc.), and used that to create a RigidBody2d class. The class allowed for the simulation of simple forces and velocities. I did not have any way to display this, so after failing to use OpenGL, I switched to the simpler SFML library. With it, I coded a RigidBodyRectangle to handle display (and soon collision detection). After that was working, I tested different simulations. I realized that to add more features, I needed surfaces and collision, so I added Surface2d and SurfaceRectangle classes. These are the same as RigidBody2d‚Äôs, except they don‚Äôt have velocity or netForce. I also setup a m/s -> px/s scale and delta time.˚ˆHello,
Ive made my extension for low-end laptops and pc's.
Even if you have fast machine this extension will not disappoint you!
This extension Ive made is making your experience in Flavortown even better:
when you install this extension and reload the Flavortown page you will have additional settings in the settings menu:
to stop the snow, Hide Duplicate Attachments(bug when uploading in the dev logs, that is really annoying), Optimize Devlog Feed with Improving scrolling by lazy-rendering posts AND Extreme Performance Mode that blocks analytics and hides heavy assets.
With this extension your clicks is instant without delays!
If you have suggestions or questions, please add a comment.
Thanks!

hiRAdded the lap-time and sectors system and went from the terminal to an actual HUD.ÿFinally got around to doing a devlog. So far, my game has player movement and basic abilities, a couple basic rooms, and a save/load system. The last few days I've mostly been working on the title/file select screen.I just got that idea yet—I've finished up the basic structure of the website, and got the list of countries and regions (that contain Google Street View) going.

You can do all the fancy stuff easily through the toolbar, and even see a preview.
> Hope you have fun!
~~The preview was kinda hard tbh~~œI made/uploaded a demo site where you can see the extension before you install it.
I already made the extension before I installed Hackatime, so all that time isn't tracked :(
Hope you enjoy the extension!Animated the first section too!˚I## Implemented SFX!
There's now SFX for placing pieces, spins, comboing and perfect clear. I've definitely spent way more time then a hour but hackatime is not avaliable for audacity and musescore :(

I'm think the sound of spin is kind of weird and does not fit, though. I might change it later.

delete connection code on reload The timer screen and bad habits!˚îToday I started working on my hackathon project, a Magical Christmas Scene built using only HTML and CSS. I designed a festive UI with a warm color palette and added falling snow animation to create a winter vibe. The main focus was to keep the project lightweight, responsive, and visually appealing.

I added a starry night background, glowing elements, and styled the text to give it a soft holiday feel. I faced some alignment and layering issues while working with animations, but fixed them using proper positioning and z-index.

Next, I plan to improve animations, polish the UI, and add more interactive details to make the experience more magical.òI added the use of the users current location by asking through the browser prompt along with the search bar to change and find weather for other cities I'm working on my dummy project.GWOOOw FIRST SECTION DOONNNE LESS FUCKING GOO!

- New homepagei am making a esp based display˚GAdded key phrase to login functionality, also did some testing to find out that I haven't actually handled exceptions thrown by supabase. authentication checks to be implemented, and logout functionality implemented. fixed inconsistencies with UI experience. also did some research on cryptography functions supported by python˚°![Logo](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/raw/main/.github/assets/logo.png?raw)
# Changes
---
- [9eae3a1](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/9eae3a18873451d1a4b75a52782d3ed21b25f44c): I added response decoding using a state machine system that populates a request object as its fed data. I designed the system to be robust to an extent that even if it receives data in chunks of 8 bytes it is able to properly construct a response object.
- [c9c0f02](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/c9c0f02810b6cf763ab992a255e5daa8d83b1fb6): Added a little helper function to get a nice display of the response

# Next steps
---
1. Actually look at HTTPS˚§tldr: links, lists, inline styling

support links & lists as their own blocks now
before links & lists were just.. being ignored/being treated in the paragraph blocks
so now they're their own block

- started using arrays of spans instead of raw text to support inline styling.

like

spans: [<text, bold>("This"), <text,italic>("is")]

before it was just one chunk of text, and so nothing would really get flagged in that if that makes sense. because the way it was calculated with mean and median the text & stuff.

post-processing; just made a separate module that cleans up after the parsed output. more of a refactor kinda thing. but also added some filters to start it off. like removing duplicate links, cleaning up those language selectors.

- added a few tests; performance ones, i'll do smoke test (just examining it myself) for the rest.

and a little bit of shuffling and refactoring, i always do that..Added the ability to filter ratings on my map!˚HI looked for feedbacks in slack and some gamedev discord server and altered a few things: 
- The line clear particles and spin-clear texts has been reworked to fetch the color of current skin on runtime so the color doesn't look that weird.
- Made the board even more bouncy!

I'll now begin to work on adding sound effects.1cleaning the code(?) i just re-write the functionSAdded tab icons! (And all the other things I already logged on my previous project)êFinished the map intergration, and actually ported it from figma into the web, i fell asleep after doing this lol and forgot to post the update.˚ˇIDV protection? Hell yeah! #idv-only only lets IDVed members join. 

Whitelists are now a thing, and /blam whitelist channel keeps all members in the channel allowed for the future.

/blam help shows all available commands. 

Lots of perf improvements

/idv test basically runs through the users and finds out how many of them would be affected by a /blam idv - it does need performance improvements soon :pf:

That's about it for now! Lots of edge cases are hanging around that need to be patched up.˚dThe cumulative progress changing instantly is now a thing after order change, before it didnt work, needed a refresh. Also fixed a lot of theme stuff, like fixing inconsitencies across the 3 themes, fixing the user section in navbar for ocean theme, making the profile page, not feel so blocky with themes, themed the orders section, and some other things.sI have made the frontend of my website and the Tic Tac Toe game. Still working on fixing bugs and making more gamesÅI made basic rick roll working and copy the link button. https://cute-cat.pages.dev/ You have to click before rick roll shows up.˚m![Spicetown logo with white text.](https://i.ibb.co/4R9q41hn/Group-11.png)

## Removed
Removed & deprecated ESLint workflow checks because it kept highlighting an issue that wasn't an issue >:(PFixed some responsiveness issues. Really excited to ship it! v1.0.0 is out! üòÉ˚ O que foi feito: Ontem foi o "Big Bang" do projeto AI Video Factory.

1. If you have any known to me IDE open and you try to open any known to my AI service the tab is deleted
2. You get redirected to a Medium article on why you should stop vibe coding,MI am learning godot game enine right now and am excited to build my own game.]Just improving the previos two day's work. added some beter font,colors and improved grammar.7Made the word and character counter app. Pretty simple.nice devlog lolnow you can edit your profile4Endpoints work now! Just deploying :ultrafastparrot:™Spent nearly 4 hours figuring out convex and setting it up in a turborepo with better-auth. It finally works!

Currently trying to figure out whether to use convex entsrCompleted unit tests for the lexer.

Attached: I learnt quite a bit about macros. More comfortable with 'em now.Pso it was because i nested `a` tags... what did i expect i guess i deserved thatrI have implemented most of the functionality, now its time to make the endpoints for redirecting :ultrafastparrot:@I assembled the rest of the combinations in CAD

It was a pain1accounts exist now which are a nice thing to haveÛso my plan was just to modify the pagefind ui styling so that it doesn't go off the damn phone screen and become a minor constituent of the air and i decided i'd do some homepage improvements too, and now... i think the screenshot tells it all˚êNothing fancy, not even really a hardware project. I‚Äôve always wanted to make things though, so this started out of pure curiosity. This is my aquarium pump. I lost the impeller inside it, the tiny spinning fan that actually moves the water. Instead of throwing it away, I‚Äôm trying to understand how it works and figure out if I can rebuild or hack a replacement, mostly as a learning experiment.mUpdate README to outline commit guidelines and add git hooks (this took _way_ longer than it should have...).JAdded a border line and made the installer use the entire terminal screen.æI started to Assemble a few of the models in CAD.

After messing around in the assembly studio for 30 minutes I was able to assemble my first model

Here is a screenshot of the the model{Accidentally worked on this file in flavortown-watcher :pensive:

Wrote a few helpers to check if someone's IDV verified.`I started working on the projects page, and made the server side loading on the guestbook better˚	Added ppu.py (pixel processing unit) to handle the graphics, modified registers.py and cpu.py to add more opcodes so it can run classical games such as tetris. Displays a green screen as of now but after developing main.py it should display the rom which is tetris.˚Downloaded data from the UK Foods Standard Agency and successfully figured out how to display 600k businesses on a Leaflet map (not at once though X_X). Prettified the markers with official FHRS and FHIS hygiene images as well as basic info about each business.˚¥After working for a bit, I can finally say that I have completed a fully functioning game website! I have completed the first releas,e and I will see if I want to add more features! This was a very entertaining and easy project that I can ship quickly!!
Can't say I didn't use some help! BUT hey, i learnt a lot about web dev.
This release includes a random word picker, 6 trial system, a responsive design and a lot of fun and hints!˚¥After working for a bit, I can finally say that I have completed a fully functioning game website!

Can't say I didn't use some help! BUT hey, i learnt a lot about web dev.
This release includes a random word picker, 6 trial system, a responsive design and a lot of fun and hints!}Fully coded and finished the password generator. (Don't try it on my vault check website ü§£ ) ,and added the about section.˚Thanks Amber for the idea! #arcade-hcb-tracker was pretty cool, but text is bland. So I used Slack's Block Kit to make a few blocks, and show it in red or green.

Then, I began displaying all tags on the bottom of the card.

I noticed the link on the transaction from the Arcade HCB tracker was probably to an internal log. I copied it :D

I don't have any ideas for what to add/change, so for now this will be the first and last devlog. If you have any ideas for what to add, or even for an alternate UI for this, I'm all ears!˚kWhoah, first devlog! Lots of progress so far:

1. Tried to use libsql, failed miserably -> chose to use the tried and trusted sqlite
2. Figured out how to auth and use XOXP tokens to kick users
2.5. Added a whole lot of cruft in the process :P
3. Individual users can now be prevented from joining (need to figure out how to add custom filters)
4. Made the bot and the user both readd each other in case of removal by a non channel manager

But then, I ran into a problem - occasionally, XOXP tokens don't work to kick. And users added to channels don't seem to be able to kick immediately. And even more worryingly, even with channel manager given to the kicking user, it fails. I believe it's because the XOXP has to be refreshed (manually?!) each time it's added.

Yeah, that's not going to work. I made a little hack that uses XOXC and XOXD tokens instead to kick, and it works!

I skipped over a lot of detail in how many times I failed, but yeah that's about it!

Also - I'm really kind of happy with the _env implementation I landed on. I wrap all my getenv calls in a custom function which validates the vars.˚∑Brainstorming the ideas for which MCU, ESC to use for the drone. I had to consider what components I can actually solder, and what is my design philosophy for this project. I decided that I am going to have 4 ESC modules on each arm of the pcb so that I reduce the length of the phase traces for the motors. This is an exciting but also kind of overwhelming part of project because decisions made here will impact everything down the line.0I have build my own microcontroller like arduino˚For the uhh past very long while I tweaked around with Svelte. SInce im still a newbie at svelute it took me quite a bit of time and a bit of chatgpt to get used to it. HOWEVER I decided that I'm going to use catppuccin for the theme and make the animations flat! it's the kind of style that I *really* enjoy using and it's the one that I will be using! So far I got the base ui setup and the api sends data to the console. For the next devlog, I want to be able to format the teams from the api into the appropriate columnslIt just a simply email tool to practise my html skill and designer is an email editer with my email templateõAdded basic lexer (check the crate "lexer").
Will add unit tests for it and add a tokeniser too.

(Attached is the state of the code right now. Tedious)˚first devlog, added the basic cat sprite(ik it looks rlly bad ill change it later) and made it draggable/throwable. I played around with a lot of stuff cause its my first time using unity and also probably spent a lot more time than I should have tryign to get my code to work üò≠i have a home page˚ÈI made a bunch of changes, not really to the base functions, but rather to the looks and stuff. Every graphic / former emoji now sources from the Lucide React library. Claude/I did a reorganization of the files (it added a backend for some reason but I'll just keep it there for now). In addition, there is now a photography page, with photos I've taken (layout kinda inspired by vsco.co), a background for the website, so the 'translucency' (?) is more visible, and a bunch of CSS changes (a lot of the three hours were just fixing CSS üò≠). There were some other features added though, including a shattering effect when you enter the konami code (up up down down left right left right B A), a navigation button, and a time travel slider that is in progress, which will hopefully show the viewer different iterations of the website in the past when completed. 

Next steps are probably adding a few more pages, fixing/fully implementing the time travel slider, connecting a few things, and maybe changing some other aspects of the CSS.

Also, thank you +raghavbansal.sphere for the suggestion! Unfortunately I didn't see it till now, but I will likely implement some form of an achievements/projects section in the homepage!

Feedback is welcome :).Probably need to brainstorm its purpose first.4The initial website is ready! Time to add more stuffNI added themes and difficulties which let you control the question yourself :D<Added The Navbar & tagline lol , nvm worked on some frontend—- Added highscores on Game Over menu
- Added a tutorial menu (can be accessed through the main menu)
- Added Music and SFX toggles
- Added delta time (so people with high refresh monitors can play normally)˚!I have been working on fixing bugs. I did a lot of clean up on the server so that it is more update with the ways I do things now. I also redid the edit houses page. I also made the auth middleware redirect back to where you were after logging in. Admins can now enable or disable cheeringoMade the DXF file, made sure it imports fine in KiCAD as PCB edge. Did further planning of the drone's concept.Started working on projectãi added a contact page and made some changes to the home page. its a few changes because im tired :yawn:. but tomorrow, we'll change it up!˚πI made lots of frontend advancements and I starting using Flask so I am building a simple REST web API because I have a separate frontend and backend. I am using a crystal ball üîÆ just like it my project title in my title page in the website. The color palette is yellow with purple. I am relearning Flask and GET and POST methods also. All of this is to make sure that Fable Friend is presentable (right now it just runs in the terminal).Kfinished the overview page! now it should pull all your bases and show them˚added a working a searchbar, added keybinds to quickly select todoList and Search bar, working on the todo list right now.

due to a site bug , i deleted this project's previous page and created a new one so i don't get fraud acquisition ( reported in #flavourtown chaneel as well )˚àIt's once again crazy hours (4:16am as I type...) but I've implemented the core mechanics of achievements now!! That's including an app to view all available achievements, little pop-up notifications when reaching achievements, and a progress bar.

A handful of other tweaks were also done behind the scenes, including support for different window sizes, and reworked window focusing logic!`fixed markdown reader formatting as apple's native markdown isn't fully supported some md format˚I added language functionality, which was a pain. The npm module listed on the wiki for OHM under maplibre doesn't work with maplibre because it's a mapbox plugin. I pulled out my hair trying to get this to work and then I realized it was because the tag was name_en not name:en. code do be do dat. I also updated the style slightly to make countries stand out and fixed a bug with the eventListener of maxEra. After this you can actually kind of use it!

todo:
1. fix the display above the slider, currently it's not positioned right but it's 10:00 and I'm too tired to fix it
2. implement saving the current map view as a png or other format
3. mess with map layers to get what I want perfectly, including fixing the fact that some country names don't show up at all
4. add a menu where you can select what features you want to show on the map, beyond the current toggles at the top (need to fix bug that they're inverted)
5. once style is locked in generate vector map tiles to use that are less weighty with somthing like tippecanoe˚˚ Before ordering the PCB, here were what I did:
- Double-checked all the routes, including cleaning up some traces
- Change all traces to 0.18mm instead of 0.2mm
- Added LEDs to the following: VBUS (5V), 3V3, and GPIO2 (idk i just randomly chose it)mI made some basic landing page, changed some styling for board and added timers to it (they doesnt work yet).ÎI think I wrote the bulk of the matrix logic! To represent the 9 keys, I chose to implement a bitmask structure where the position of a "1" indicates which key is pressed. Finished most of the code for matrix.c and wrote its interface.˚iDesigned the fuselage in CAD! I made a fuselage with a hook as at the competition the aircraft will be launched using rubber bands, my 3 designs feature different hook placements to test which is the ideal spot for a hook. The fuselage is made out of 3mm thick balsa wood with thicker 9mm wood upfront to aid with durability and correcting the center of gravity Improved the chopped ahh theming˚¨Maybe the last devlog of this project. I had submitted and it got rejected because they wanted a easier way to demo so i uploaded and publish my game on Npm

You can try it too using this command >> npm i -g aaloo <<
and then run aaloo 
and enjoy with your potato friend

ALso i fixed the issue with readme pointing to some other project readme, no idea how that happened but yeah. Now the project is ready to be reshipped˚ˇ Switched to negamax as its computationally more efficent than minimax. Implemented the backend and supabase to handle the rules, the evaluation, the match making. Now to work on the frontend! The backend is a very rough draft, it'll be improved with time.÷Finally implemented a function where the user cannot build things on top of things, and a tower life system.

To do:
- Remove placeholder sprites
- Final adjustments and cost balancing (for building)
- BackendﬂYessss, I fixed the backend and cleaned up all other errors. Then I made some cute potato icons to finish the project. This one was pretty short just to brush up on my Javascript and test out these cool Flavortown features!üI made 2 versions of horizontal and vertical stabilizers of different sizes, I intend to test both of them in order to figure out which one of them is the bestQmade the first page! yeh, it's a work in progress. im getting the jist of svelte!\I finished the docs page of landslide browser, therefore completing the whole landslide app.7Shifted from L293D shield to L293 IC to make it compactAdding words!$its a dummy project with dummy words1I added two new wing profiles of different shapes4I finished the blueit app for the landslide browser."created the banner for the projectÇGetting started with the website. I added in some SVG buttons, turned them black. I still have a bit more to improve with the CSS.˚PCOMPLETELY FINISHED. A big bug that i hadn't noticed before (because i didn't type huge messages) is that the rotate rotor logic was wrong. Last rotors wouldn't seemed like they would never move. What was happening was they were moving every time before. Idrk how to explain it, but the fix was that you only check rotor at position i if rotor at position i-1 moved. then i added the whole cookie logic so you can actually keep the rotor positions without leaving the tab open. And because i added cookies, i also had to add a reset rotor button. Also i added the instructions page. Done now!˚ñThis was a pretty simple project, so only 1 devlog. I was debating on whether or not to use tailwind CSS for this and ultimately decided to just stick with plain CSS because I didn't want to make a complicated build step and just wanted to deploy it easily on Github pages, and I couldn't get the play CDN to give me autocomplete in VSCode. As for the actual design, I just modeled the days as some objects with attribues for prize, snowflakes, and the additional snowflake amount for not taking the prize, as well as a few other details. I then just looped over the days and cretae buttons for each option, recalculating all the prizes when a selection is made.ÂI‚Äôve got some basic controls working. As shown in the video, movement (WASD) is controlled using the jog wheels on both decks. My next goal is to build a fully configurable system that anyone can adapt to their own preferences.SO COOL :DDD'Worked on the selector ui, so selector.˚cTL;DR I Created a fully functional password generator and created basic authentication logic. 
So, I used a library called wonderwords, pretty cool tbh. also using supabase as I mentioned previously. The app generates a few keywords and hashes them with a salt in the database. (security is important as this is also the encryption key for the passwords)˚±Designed the main app in Figma. Progress is slow, but I hope I'll get better at it.

Designing is actually kinda fun. Previously I made websites by jumping straight into the coding without planning, and the end result was not what I had imagined at all. Using Figma though, this design already looks way better than what I had originally planned, and unlike before, I am actually excited this time to implement this design in code.˚®Made the spotify API display the title, artist, and photo of the album. Also moved the spotify api logic into a hook which updates every 1.5 seconds, meaning the data changes if you switch songs. The forward and back buttons are also full functioning now too. Now I need to implement the play and pause button, which I want to be a single button. I also need to fix the authentication to auto refresh once the token expires.˙Currently I'm working on the CAD model of the drone and all its components. So far I've completed the full 2D design on paper and have created a bill of materials to work with so I can create an accurate CAD model with all the parts I'm going to use.=O owo owo owo˚ãI wrote a Python script that allows selecting a MIDI controller and displays all incoming input data in real time. The script detects buttons, knobs, faders, and jog wheels and prints their MIDI events, making it easy to analyze and understand the controller‚Äôs behavior. Next, I‚Äôm starting to figure out the best way to track these inputs and translate them into real Minecraft key bindings.#trying to make it native to node.jsyAdded google drive api. Deploys to streamlit.io. project: https://receipty.streamlit.app/. Made dashboard and upload page˚=Massive refactor across the board with this one
Main changes were:
- fixing session to make it a little more consistent throughout the project
- fixed the exporter code so now it exports a parquet file correctly
- improved the session creation ui
- removed the accidental dox from the parquet file by switching to relative dirs
- general minifixes 

but now the project is in a functional state and can do its original job as intended :D
likely will ship here and continue adding features
Example of a Huggingface dataset made from this project: https://huggingface.co/datasets/CattoYT/honkers-railway (hoyoverse no bully me pls)

Idk what to put for the attachment so im just going to put the raw views of the data there from https://parquet-viewer.com lol (the audio is there it just doesnt display on this website)∑Fixed collision stuff and added CPU logic. The game is now playable with an opponent. The CPU is only allowed to move once the ball is on the right side which makes the game winnable.˚wYou can download your Shonk now!!
I achieved this by transforming the preview from simple <p> elements into a HTML canvas which I can easily transform into an image you can download. This took a while but it finally works! I'll also try to add the option to either download it with a transparent background or the with the background my site uses (or a custom one, idk yet).˚NI decided to update and improve the modal animations so that the images and captions now fade and slide in smoothly, and the close button appears more naturally. Now the modal layout adapts better to different screen sizes, so the artwork feels more centered. Next, I might adjust the module to look bigger and maybe some other stuff.˚§I should become Amish, with all my struggling with coding :(

# Struggles
- The backend wasn't filtering assignments properly and showing assignments that are due within the month. But turns out the frontend was creating assignments for November and I was checking for assignments for December
- Drizzle was complaining about a SQL query not working. Turns out, I was querying for a nonexistant column by accident :(
 Nothing was showing in the tabs on the frontend for the assignments sidebar because the HTML was looking for a nonexistant slot name :(


But now you can see a calendar and a list of assignments you completed and stuff you still need to complete :DDD˚ìBrining back an abandoned project, a hack club sticker collection dashboard that utilizes Hack Club Auth's new OAuth2 features. For now It has a simple admin dashboard that allows importing stickers with duplication checks and simple page to set your inventory. The page has some filtering to make it easier to find the stickers you have. All data is brought from the https://hackclub.com/stickers page.≠added per-screen decorations! physics enabled:tm:!

probably gonna move onto something more fun (random events)Start learning!ZFull thing fully works! I'll test with a small group and collect feedback before shipping.<Started creating a short interactive tutorial for MonomarketVHaven't written much code yet, but I have created some basic wireframes and componentsöStarted trying to learn UI for the healthbar, ended up making the menu screen first. Not the best but I'm no artist, trying to get them working right now.Dgot my timer working, still trying to get it to layout properly üò≠˚FOver the last two days, I started implementing some authentication features for the API. Since I‚Äôm writing this project completely without AI, progress has been a bit slow, but I‚Äôm still happy with what I‚Äôve achieved so far.

Next, I‚Äôll start finishing the implementation of a PostgreSQL database (I‚Äôm currently only using a JSON variable) and then begin experimenting with the frontend, since I don‚Äôt have any experience with it yet.

See you tomorrow!!

# Changes
---
- [0784aeb](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/0784aebcb62d4bd168a102f3f6d976e977fc2fa2): Started work on the HTTP client that will be sending requests and receiving responses. The next commit should have the actual sending moved into a separate function so that different HTTP Protocols can send requests differently.

- [ba895e8](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/ba895e85706d86f58dd9ee9267e49688dfebdc8c): I added integrity checks to requests, different send methods depending on protocol, basic response decoding (only enough for HTTP/0.9 for now), and a basic Client struct so you can specify an address once and send requests to it multiple times

---

# Next Steps
---

1. Implement response handling for HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1
2. Look into adding support for HTTPSñjust added languages with extra subtitle descriptors to Videos page. e.g Spanish (Latin), Spanish (Spain); Chinese (Traditional), Chinese (Simplified)∑Took a while, but finally, I fixed some major bugs to hopefully get a majority of the system working properly. There are definitely some things that need to be improved, but it works!˚*Added a custom service option that appears in the add subscription modal for when you're adding a subscription from a service that doesn't have a preset on Subtrack. You can name the custom service subscription whatever you want and completely fully customize it and edit it. This required a bit of refactoring and cleaning up of the add subscription modal so I did it and fixed some bugs related to custom plans and pricing as well. Also updated styling so more services can fit in one page. Added an account username label on the profile popup as well.˚UHello,
Ive made the share events feature and now the users can buy tickets for events and see them, the creator of the event can see now the tab guests and all the guests from the events.
Theirs few other things Ive made, but there is a lot of bugs that I have to fix, but Im tired now, so I'll make it tomorrow. 
Thats it for today, bye.lI added a GUI (which is experimental) to allow the dynamic mixing of Patterns, to create quite funny results˚Ç# Devlog 9: Crafting Recipes, Creative Tabs, and Rocket Items
All items currently in the mod that are intended to have crafting recipes now do. Rockets also now properly have an item that they will drop when destroyed. The mod also now has a Polymer creative tab that will show up if you have the client-side Polymer mod installed (or can be accessed otherwise with /polymer creative).˚:improved enhanced rendering again - not done yet :/ 
Added (new) better sprites and new ore (lead, basic is iron)

TODO:
-finally (hopefully) finish the rendering system (seems like I might have found the issue)
-add menus (if the system works ;) )
-(maybe core mechanics if the system doesn't take too long)˚‹I updated Fable Friend to NOT forget everything that happens. Now there is a clean loop between you and Fable Friend, and its ability to see what's happening in the story and remember and generate storylies has greatly improved. The only problem is that it focuses on the initial situation too much instead of just moving on. I also investigated frontend options such as Github pages and digital ocean backend hosting, and starting working on it, but nothing is confirmed yet.˚}I finished up making a new Kotlin Fabric project + Stonecutter versioning and moving over all the old logic and "files" from Chat To Discord to this project. Then I translated them into Kotlin counterparts, and changed them to utilise Stonecutter. 
Now sadly I still have to work out some JVM quirks, so I don't have anything to show, instead, have this picture of a Mixin class using Stonecutter to work for 1.20.X and 1.21.X!

Next up: fixing JVM quirks, and then improving the old logic and codebase! After that, I want to attempt messing with Sockets for a connection with an independently hosted bot (using our Krafter software).BI'm currently working on making the main menu for my visual novel.pJust started off mapping out the process slowly and spent time setting up new development setup as I switched PC˚1I am super proud on the progress, the backend has almost been perfected, only the frontend is left to work on. 
the gemini analyser works as intended, takes in a prompt and gives data back.
file managment is super minimal and efficient.
orchestrator is minimal.
lyrics fetching ehh, as good as can be.˚¬I made the backend work!! 

Then broke it five minutes later.. 

I got greedy trying to add a few extra features like conformational changes to the tabs on google when they are asleep and broke the functionality of the extension, but at least the frontend looks cooler! I also made it so that you can sleep (or wake up) each tab separately. I tried debugging and gave up, but fear not, I will be back!  (Yes I'm rewatching AOT, it's just so peak)˚±kind of a small update but i made the settings that you set save after ever game since it kindm of annoying if you set a specific settign and then after it gets removed, same thing with players and caragories and imposter count, i also worked on a few errors and warnings to make it feel like better on my side, i also make the code to match the imposter to the name so i can get ready to implement the actual game and revealing pageMade it look pretierüî•WVersion v0.1
- Playable version
- Full ANSI Color support
- Work in progress version˚qI began with the Parcour, at the moment I'm only using the Starter Materials from Unreal Engine but I think thats also kinda cool when you have like benches, doors and huge rocks to jump on, maybe I'll add a history on how that happened so it kind of gets a story. I will also have to do a lot of stuff in Camera Movement/Settings, Character Customization and Textures.˚dMinor tweaks:
- Rounded corners on usage meter bars
- Changed usage meters to a color thats easier on the eyes (more desaturated)
- Added some margin between processes in the process list
- Sorting starts at None
- Some more cleaning up in the code
- Pressing the nuke button opens an "are you sure?" dialog before completely obliterating the process}I just worked on setting up the codebase and then also started on the main thing. Currently researching more parts of the GPU
more fixesAdding words!!!˚®app init, connected the api, also, i stole a bit of code from my hackatime-ios project, keychain and api to be specific, then, wired the api to flavortown, and then to the home view, i didnt expect pagination, but it was fun to implement in the app! getting a summary, but the UI is really demo right now, using a navigation stack so i dont have to worry about alignments, will change. but im getting an summary of the user!clocked in on figma, so I designed the website in figma :yay: As you see from right to left with cooAThe pictures didn't upload from the last devlog, so here they areI'm shipping the appäFor languages that have more than 1 subtitle option, e.g. Spanish (Latin), Spanish (Spain); Chinese(Simplified), Chinese(Traditoinal) etc.ÕAdded custom themes, letting you change the colors of the application by editing a variable file (maybe make it a config later?)
Added dark theme (i dont like it ngl, but now it exists if people wants it)ÍI worked on the CTF writeup section of my project, I also wrote a demo for a chall I did a while ago. There is a cool obfuscated text animation and a system to take in markdown files and render them as html. Also made the code better.©I created an icon for the app in Figma. It's my first icon/logo ever!
It's really simple - my school's logo (the face) with a golden medal often associated with sports.˚&I updated the buzzer logic so it only triggers once when a threshold is exceeded, instead of continuously.
I also updated the Fritzing schematic to include the buzzer and adjusted the wiring accordingly.
Finally, I set up and organized the initial GitHub repository structure for the project.kKnob rotation is fixed!
Now every turn is detected correctly, yay.
The solution?
Even more bit patterns.ôStarted on the art for the home page of my website
Added typewriter style animations for the headers on the about page
Added images for the backgrounds1This is my second game. It's a simple platformer.˚j# Harbor Browser
Harbor Browser is going to be a browser where I write every major service myself. This means everything from:
- HTTP client
- HTML/CSS parser and renderer
- JS interpreter

And anything else a traditional browser would have must be written by me. I'm trying to limit myself to as few dependencies as possible.

## Progress
I decided to use `winit` and `wgpu` as the windowing and GPU abstraction layers. They'll be doing a lot of the heavy lifting for this project, I suspect. I got a basic window opening and cleared with a color. It doesn't sound like much but that was 250 lines of code :|˚¥Le Potato Has Been Created! ü•îü•îü•îü•îü•î

The extension has been created and I decided to go with a potato theme lol 

I also finished the base frontend for when the extension is actually clicked where you can select how much time you want your tabs to be untouched for before the magic potato puts them to sleep and saves you some yummy RAM :)  

I still need a cute potato mascot but that's a story for another devlog...˚v![Spicetown logo with white text.](https://i.ibb.co/yBhBsGyf/Group-11-1.png)

# Spicetown Website
## Fixed
Fixed Lunar Version grabbing directly from the artifact when I could just put the user on the workflow page instead

## Added
Added Firefox addons redirection button.
Added image preview of Spicetown as the background.iI didn't get to the AI training yet, but I changed the movement system a little and got dragging to work.ïOrganized code (no changes to the program, just to make the code across the project more consistent).
Idk what images to add so here, have some code˚ûadded the 2 new Bogre dishes: Uncanny Pottage and Stinky Bouillon. Also made some changes to the Fish-Snot Chowder. apparently it was a FoodItem not a BowlFoodItem so you could just eat the entire bowl along with the chowder. fixed that and also made it not give nausea if you ate it underwater. Here are the mechanics i was instructed to implement:

1. Uncanny pottage (requires spider eye or rotten flesh). After eating player will get new effect - rotting disguise making nearby monsters neutral for 30 secs (means if player attacks them they immediatly attack back). adds 3 hunger and saturation and gives Hunger effect for 15 secs.
2. Stinky bouillon (requires poisonous potato). Restores 4 hunger and saturation and removes all negative effects from player. for every negative effect that was removed +3 saturation and hunger restoration. Gives poison 1  for 10 secs if no statuses was removed.
3. Fish-snot chowder (requires fish as usual) consuming gives Nausea for 15 secs and restores 8 hunger and saturation. If was eaten underwater no Nausea will appear.

Everything is done, but i still need an icon for the Rotting Disguise Effect, im using rotten flesh for now.0example devlog// finally made a hackclub account⁄This is my very first project for Flavourtown and so far, I've just worked on figuring out the layout of this website and the features I want to include in it! I also finally got the bottom nav bar to work üò≠ (yayyy)EThis is my third project
Added it to Github and made my first commit˚3Successfully implemented the basic functionality of the Spotify Web API. Finished the implementation of fetching the token after the user logs in which now lets me get information about the type of song the user is listening to. Now I have to make it so that the data refreshes when the user switches songs.DI changed how the functions are structured, now to change them more.˚ùI made a few changes to the level editor, like adding slopes and also I changed the bitfields from having 1 byte be a tile to every 8 bytes since I now have slopes as well as regular tiles and I need to differentiate between the two. I made it 8 bytes to make it easier for the computer as well as to future proof if I need to add more tiles. I added two new features to the level editor, rendering as an image, and exporting the level collider. The rendering renders the level into an image where each tile is 20 by 20 pixels, the colors are extremely boring because I will use this render as a base for me to paint over and actually make a good level. The exporting colliders takes in the bitfield of the level, finds every edge and saves it in a counter clockwise winding order to a file. I made changes to the actual game by adding a function that converts this collider file into a vector of points. I added a new rigidbody collider type called Chain. I used tons of boxes in my previous project to make the colliders for the level, but to optimize the collision in this project, I used chain shapes in Box2D which makes collision for the environment a lot simpler and faster.’Worked on adding the about page for the website. Currently the vision is to have a giant floating button to download my cv and afterwards having a three for a more detailed story. Currently no where near finished.ÍI implemented different layers so that potential energy can be defined over the simulation space. The dark blue regions in the picture below have higher potential energy and almost act as boundaries for the wave function in this case.≤Final change to psu connector.

Made some progress with the enhanced rendering system, however I still have a long way to go...
The enhanced rendering system now actually boots and works, core features are not present yet :/

TODO:
-complete the system (!)
-add menus
-add core game mechanics˚0The video wallpaper support is now fully integrated and stable. The engine is optimized for high-performance playback, handling high-resolution loops without impacting system speed.

Implemented Settings
- fpsLimit: Cap the video frame rate to conserve battery and GPU power.
- muteAudio: A simple toggle to silence video wallpapers instantly.

How It Works 
To ensure the best possible performance, I engineered a custom solution using Libmpv:
- Hardware Acceleration: The engine offloads processing to your GPU (`d3d11`), keeping CPU usage near zero.
- Seamless Looping: I implemented a memory cache system that pre-loads the video into RAM, ensuring loops repeat perfectly without any pauses or stutter.
- FPS Control: The FPS limiter uses an internal video filter to drop frames efficiently, reducing resource usage without causing "slow-motion" effects or audio desync.

I added the first video wallpaper to the marketplace - 'Quasar pixel moewalls'

Still working on the launcher launch bug - when the launcher window opens, it sometimes appears blank.˚7I now got a playable top-view racing game. I included 14 different tanks and a checkpoint system as well as collisions (which may or may not be a bit fucked up but just learn to drive I guess).
Next step will be to create a timer and a laptime system with green sectors, purple sectors etc between checkpoints.added the selction’- When searching processes are now pushed upwards to not make them appear randomly in the middle of the list
- All byte conversions are now dynamically done with a helper function to support a range of byte sizeslCleaner UI and customizable amount of threads being used, dynamic iteration changing for the best experience˚Created the basic setup of the project( .py files and the main game loop). Also added a main menu screen and added movement to the player. 

Github commit of this devlog: https://github.com/Daniel908009/Asteroids-2/commit/86b4cc1f1e200979fbf41ae589acc760dd93d03eI am making a personal website.WWrote additional features to the script and pushed to github. Also wrote a readme file.˚€Woops! I forgot to devlog when I last committed so I've now got 2 things to devlog about, and quite a lot of time!

The more interesting thing is that non-warped procedures (custom blocks without "run without screen refresh" enabled) are now supported; this required large changes to the scheduler which I expected to have a very large performance impact, but it seems to be ok for now. Will keep an eye on it.

I also redid the JS that actually runs the project, both to make it cleaner (it basically hasn't changed since I first wrote it awfully 3 years ago), and to be able to reuse the same project runner in the integration tests. This all works nicely, and we now have 33% of tests passing which I think is very exciting!hnow a had completed the other pages of my web site like login page , ordering page and the ordering menu˚„Hiii, this is my first devlog, I worked on both the hardware and firmware foundations for SenseBox Mini.
I created the initial hardware schematic in Fritzing, connecting the ESP32-C3 with the SHT31 temperature & humidity sensor and the CCS811 air quality sensor over a shared I2C bus. The design focuses on simplicity, using only the required pins and powering all components at 3.3V.

In parallel, I started the firmware setup by initializing the I2C bus and preparing the basic project structure for reading sensor data. This step ensures that the hardware design and firmware architecture align correctly before adding more advanced features such as alerts and the web interface.

There is a 2 minute cooldown for the cheer button, but i disabled it for the video˚kFinally completed the project. Phew!!!

Just added 1 simulation for Biology instead of 3.
I designed UI inspired by Notion.

GUYS am I cooked......?|i made a very _very_ basic site! i know shit about webdev so it aint much but i'm proud of it so far. tailwind css is weird.˚ºHeavily optimized performance, while improving structure.
Performance improvements:
- Removed/moved unnecessary styles
- Inlined & minimized the CSS so the browser doesn't have to make several calls to download the CSS (the CSS is built into the HTML, before it would have to download the HTML and afterwards the CSS, which added a delay. Unfortunately now there is no caching, but the stylesheet was small enough not to need it.)
- Preloaded the Merriweather font

Structure improvements:
- Fixed elements that had no closing tag
- Formatted the code
- Added description metadata
- Modified header structure in order to be more accessible to screen readers

HOWEVER, we're not 100% optimized yet! There's one more goal left, and that is to remove unused CSS from pages that don't use it, aka tree shaking.

I'm not going to implement that manually, of course, because I'm lazy. I would've done it with a Jekyll plugin but whoops, GitHub Pages doesn't support the plugin I need, so that'll be for another time.

I chose to use my macropad project that I made earlier because I did not want to order and wait for a pcb. In a future itteration may change that, and will change the key morphology accordingly. But for now, we are working with a 3x3 switch grid and an encoder. the config file is just defining constants that we'll use in the project, such as which gpio pins each row/col are, how much the debounce is, ect... Now time to code the header files with which functions I anticipate I'll need!òI spent almost 3 hours (more than 3 actually) trying to fix the building collisions, but after searching I've found simpler solutions and I'll try them.˚$QoL Improvements!

22 hours since ship and here are some improvements to make life easier and have a more comfy experience.

- Textarea (or input) now allow pressing "Enter" to submit the message. This behavior can be avoided if you press "Shift" while pressing enter to just input a new line.
- Scroll area added to chat section. If the message list were about ~10 messages, the page broke itself. Now a scrollarea was added, all messages is pushed to this component and the scroll is managed inside this area, no more ugly overflows.
> Also, when a new message is created, the scroll is automatic to match the bottom of the area.
- System prompt fine-tunned. (expect this for a period of time, i need to find the best match)

Changed the breakout board holder as I didn't like how the old one barely held the breakout board inside.˚'I added a new CheckBox class to my GUI features, and added a checkbox to the sidebar to provide the option do display the grid or not. I struggled with a surprising amount of bugs making this work. I had problems with accidentally overwriting variable without realising it (oops), and a bug in which I accidentally swapped the colours for the check box being on and off. I spent far to much time trying to figure out why the label text was not rendering before realising that I had forgotten to input any. Many silly mistakes took up a lot of my time.˚Now when you perfect clear, it does a cool spin! 

You might think that this update is not as 'packed' as my previous devlogs, but it's because while I've done quite a lot, it's all just refactoring my spaghetti, and I don't know how to present it.

I've also poked around the repo of Flavortown. In theory, if I include this link: https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01504DCLVD/p1766762314668419, I'll get an achievement, let's try it!

I also fixed the issues selecting options in the drop down. I had forgotten that I needed to get the relative mouse position as my buttons were on a separate surface.

I neglected to mention in my previous devlog, but the reason that I am starting with the editro, is that my previous attempt at this game failed in part due to me trying to place every object by editing the code, which was very painful.ÉGot the main website design done for now!

* Every display (the board, next and hold piece) now uses the same skin system, so I don't have to apply skin 3 times. If you look closely at my last devlog you'll see some discrimination, which is now fixed :D

* Reworked the spin animation so it looks more smooth

* Adjusted Next piece display's height so it doesn't have an awkward blank space

* Most importantly, I've visualized what clears have you made and the back to back chain, and I'm quite happy with the animation!


(In case this devlog looks weirdly spaced, sorry. Flavortown's markdown is in a weird state rn. The subtitle renders correctly but not the bullet points and they just disappeared. I'm adding some space between those bullet points to try to make it easier to read, and I have no idea how this will turn out.)updatedIt's working!!!First stepspso i added more tools + css. i need to think about some more tools to implement, this project is easily scalableÜMore tests, more subtle bugs. This time, GitHub Copilot found this bug that slipped through testing, and so I added a testcase for it.˚!Hello, in this devlog i created or better said, improved the way, all of the settings are displayed in a drastic way, so that you have multiple settings pages, from which you can switch to the next, privious or so on page just by clicking the buttons at the bottom.

Hope you likte it :)˚aI made the wing of the aircraft in On Shape, For the specs of the wing I decided on 50 cm wingspan as it fits between the minimum wingspan of 30cm and maximum wingspan of 60cm, I decided to make the wing out of 2 stacked layers of balsa wood and also decided to add a 3 degree dihedral to the wing for stabilization, This is how the wing currently looks˚ßFor this devlog i did:
- Add view and simulation distance to config
- Generate more regions around 0,0, now making 4 regions
- Only send chunks that are within the distance client accepts (view distance * 2 + 7), so it needs to send from 4 different regions if you are on 0,0
- Load block data from an json file so i can access block ids with "BLOCKS.get("minecraft:grass_block").unwrap().default"
- Fix sending blocksMstarted working on the "rate" page, so far just got the date selector working‘Added buttons to clickly change how many shares you want to buy/sell on the prediction market
Also added buttons to buy more or sell you shares on the owned shares overview page.
And added tab titles & favicon.Qmade the main structure of the app, need to add css to the tools + add more tools˚©The knob is working! (kinda)
I wrote the code to handle the input from the knob, and now it prints into debug log when rotated left or right. However for some reason it detects only every other rotation (you need to rotate it twice in on direction to get a print). This is to be fixed. I'm also considering using interrupts for this (for fun), but the Embassy documentation is pretty lacking, so I will leave this for later.Updating UI for new features@Forgot to link Flavortown to other existing backend repositoriesd- Link Devlog to the existing GitHub repository.
- Serverless Backend with Node (still in progress)fDesigned the PSU + screw terminals connector, will now print to check if everything fits as it should.ÿI managed to get thunderbird (when no authentication or encryption) to send an email to my smtp server!

I now need to investigate:
- the .eml file format
- Sending email forward
- SSL/StartTLS
- Authentication˚◊oops, i forgor i had to devlog
# here's the changes:
pinned now makes your name truncated if its too long (whatever gizzy's display name like why tf is it so long)
shop goals progress is now in unison (not distinct) ((may add it back as an option?))
added initial keybinds feature! press ctrl + number to navigate to the page, for example:
ctrl + 1 = kitchen
ctrl + 2 = explore
ctrl + 3 = project
ctrl + 4 = vote
ctrl + 5 = shop
(coming soon?) ctrl + 6 = themestinitial commit. Alpha version. Arrange files and done some work how should it look. Prototype still but going great.úThis project is a web page that showcases short and useful Python programming tricks with simple examples to help learners code more efficiently and easily.Added main menuÑ- Today i learned Something New ‚ú® , today i learned how to git commit,push,pull , lol yeaa late but yea
- Linked CSS File To Html˚7I began working on the app using C# and I've done each menu. So far, it can detect XInput, DInput or HID controllers, added device metadata like the product/vendorID, connection types, input type and battery levels. I've also added button remapping. The Quick settings buttons currently dont have any logic yet.>Added progress bars :) Also changed the font to Pixeloid Sans.±Added cumulative goals progress so like the progress bar goes 1 by 1 instead of being invidual, also improvements to the themes, and  i made the kitchen statistics also improvedKsetting up background and font along with some cool images to fill up spaceVFor the request url I tried many ways but after some times i managed to get on workingNCoded and styled the password generator page. Functionality is yet to be coded∆This is my old project, so I want to try to rewrite it because I feel the code is not good and not easy to maintain, and plus I also want to add new features, this really drains my mind and timeü§ØÚOkay bot now makes use of devlog_ids to check so less resources during hosting and should also mean less api hits :3c also now /logpheus-stats to see how many users it has and every req has header that makes bot show up on the extensions page˚xI developed a web page that focuses on Python short tricks and useful coding techniques. The website includes concise Python tips, examples, and shortcuts that help users understand concepts quickly and improve their coding skills. This project aims to support students and beginners by providing easy-to-understand Python tricks that can be applied in real programming tasks.˚®Just added a blur behind the OS logos lol. It took like 5 minutes but the time logged is 5^2 because I couldn't figure out why tf my overlay styles weren't working. It was because I was using `>` instead of `<space>`. The difference is that `<space>` means *anywhere* within an element, and `>` means *a direct descendant of the element*. Rookie mistake on my part I thought the Eleventy watch server was tripping lmfao : ).QI'm just order the most important part, only wait 2 days until th e parts arrived˚®Just found this when searching for domain names:
https://reverseqr.com/
This is NOT my project
This 
- does not feature end to end encryption
- requires an account
- is limited in the number of sends per month
- has a paid version and only supports text shares.

I did not know about about this website when starting the project, but I am glad that I created an improved version of a closed source and paid service.7Up to know main functionalities have been impelimented.˚I added graphical quality adaptation by implementing 5 levels of quality. The site chooses the best option for your device based on your current FPS, but you can also manually select the graphical level yourself.
If you have any improvements for this feature please let me know!cI finished the MeToob page in landslide browser with some beautiful and completely unbiased videos.FAdjusted the home page and fixed some errors in the case converter app˚(SO much improvement!
- Finished the `fluentUI.scss` stylesheet WITH media query
- Added the `html-minifier-next` package after checking out other packages
- Added a bunch of scripts in `package.json`
- NEW!: Minified the (built) site! (was painful and the time didn't even get logged üò≠üôèåHonestly, I just set the GitHub and configured wakatime.
Did a lil work here and there BUT I would start the actual coding work very sooon!˚?I have started this project but had a break from it. I didn't do much before, just the authentication flow, set up the database and started working on one of the screens.
First thing when I return to this project I changed the auth flow to passwordless. The app now sends an email with a magic lin and after clicking it you return to the app and are logged in. I had countless problems setting up the SMTP with supabase (AWS SES in this instance but I will have to switch bc they denied my production access like 5 times) and deep linking, which is probably still not ideal.˚fFinished the first stage of development with sufficient features for testing.
I spent all morning doing this, and honestly it was so much fun!

Features include:
- Setting up Input Device
- Sessions creator
- Noise Calibration
- Voice Detection
- Voice Checker
- Live Transcription
- Outputting transcription

And the best part? ITS ALL REAL TIME˚UI've made the events section.
It will be a list like where the users can access all their events.
I continue with the same type of animations for the display, let me know if it look good.
Also in the video the animations a lil choppy, because my laptop is slow and cant record and do something else at one time, but you will get the idea.@Just created the slack bot and coded the leaderboard stuff first–I finished the App! I implemented the backend and worked on proper redirecting. Also analytics now shows where the app came from, which browser was used and which OS. also how many times the link was visited!˚For this devlog, we finally created our README.md  file, where we included all the basic and additional information about us and the project. If you‚Äôre curious about what the game will contain, feel free to check it out and read what we‚Äôve written there :)èI kinda got it working! After a LOT of fighting with Xcode, the app opens on iOS and macOS, however I'm still trying to get connections to workÁRewrote everything from the ground-up and I can now connect from Obsidian! I'll still have to figure out how this'll work in prod but it's one step closer :). Theoretically, building everything should be pretty straightforward now.˚I think Im gonna ship this lil project with the first dev log, I made a simple qr code generator, for text, links, contacts, wi fi, emails and more, I try to make it as much as user friendly as possible with smooth and elegant animations.
Let me know if its look good.˚µTested the authentication with firebase and found it to be dangerous to leave my firebase project APIs public like that (especially cuz u only have Admin SDK with python), so found supabase which is more forgiving and allows me to leave it fine but with the protection of RLS. Implemented database functionality via supabase and also created Row Level Security (RLS) Policies allowing users to only access their own data on the database.VThis is the final dev log for the Aman Weather systemm eyyeyey it is completed yeyeyey˚|made this piece that is gna hold on the mesh and make sure blocks dont fall out the sides
we tried fixing this with other thingys before but they all were dogshi so ig we gotta use four whole pieces of plastic for ts
anyway i swear it took so long cuz i had to make sure it wasnt too tight on the mesh and it didnt interfere with any of the rest of the bot and everything :pray:˚I need a devlog to test but the bot's handling system of new devlogs is being changed to do less work by making us of the new devlog_id in /api/v1/projects/:id making the bot and probably the api do less work thats just assuming but atleast the bot will do less work so peak!!!˚¸ I'm working on my first project! I am going to make a gesture control car using two esp-32 and two DRV8833 and MPU6050. I will also use mecanum wheels to make it move in any direction. This is so exciting. I can't wait to share more updates as I build.FThe HTML Is Complete the home screen is done next is to start the CSS.πHello this is day two of my project and i have added the second part of the story. Like i said i will add animation at the end. again the time is not updating. Where can i ask for help?Started Backend & DatabaseSWrote css and the base html for the simulations better visible when simulation done;Fully coded the decision picker. Took a little bit of time.°Well, I made the UI 10000x better, and I tried using a faster model(mistral small or large), but failed because it wouldn't follow the prompts properly

ENJOY!˚‘his devlog is apart from the coding work ‚Äî it‚Äôs mainly for my friend who‚Äôs participating in this event with me. He just finished designing our game‚Äôs banner, and I absolutely love it. It represents our game better than anything else could have.

I hope you like it as much as I do :)

Aside from that, I worked a bit more on the drag features and changed a few things in the main menu, but none of that is as cool as this banner. Ohhh, I love it so much :D˚Added a settings menu, reset button and mouse cursor repulsion for a bit of interactivity. For a bit of fun, I also added user-uploaded image support 
Here's how it works:
Settings Menu:
The sliders in the settings panel directly modify parameters (called "uniforms") that the GPU shader programs use. When you move a slider, JavaScript updates a value in GPU memory like particle size, repulsion radius, or decay speed. The next frame, the shader reads these new values and immediately changes behavior.

Reset Button:
Every particle remembers its "home" position from the original image grid. That position is stored in a texture as the initial state. When you click reset, the simulation shader reads from that stored texture instead of the current animated positions, snapping every particle back to where it started. The "life" value also resets to full, so particles fade back in smoothly.

Mouse Cursor Repulsion:
Each frame, JavaScript captures your cursor position and converts it to the 3D scene's coordinate space, then sends that position to the GPU as a uniform. In the simulation shader, for every particle (texel), it calculates the distance to the cursor. If the particle is within the "repulsion radius," it applies a force pushing the particle away.
That's it!_Changed the color scheme of all pages. Loos awesome now!!! Also, made the decision picker page.oConnected the backend with the frontend that loads stock data and also added a graph that shows real time data.4Continued working and adding new shapes and patterns2created a simple analytics UI. See the image below˚,i made some gussets and skirts for the CAD

For accessing admin dashboard and adding questions/answers tables to the database˚ƒI have successfully implemented support for Video Wallpapers within the rendering engine. This feature is built using the MPV library in Python, ensuring robust format compatibility and performance.

Performance & Controls -
- Hardware Acceleration: To maintain system efficiency, hardware acceleration is fully enabled for video playback.
- Playback Controls: I am currently developing granular controls for video settings, including specific configuration options for FPS and Resolution.

Engine Stability Fixes -
I have also resolved several synchronization bugs related to controlling the engine via the launcher. Specifically, I fixed an issue where activating a wallpaper would attempt to trigger the engine start sequence even if the engine was already running. The launcher now correctly detects the engine's state, allowing for seamless stopping and switching of wallpapers.

# I don't have any attachments to attach so i added showcase images :D˚ÂAdded a full system that lets the user pick from a list of colours and applies it to any event. For lasers, that's just a single colour, but for sweeps and circles you can give it a list of colours through which it'll alternate! You can also change the main platform's colour, which conflicted with my logic of instantiating a scene for every event. I spent SO long trying to fix that and nesting everything within an if statement to double check if it's actually spawnable fixed it! I also had issues with timing the events, as the prefire for the second sweep always went off too late, but the actual firing was on-time. The issue ended up being that I was sorting the events in order of fire beat, not spawn beat. So the platform colour change (prefire time of zero) spawned after the sweep (prefire time of 0.8s) even though it was on a lower beat. I updated the sort system to sort by prefire beat and that fixed it! The platform colour change gave me SO many issues.

tldr: PRETTY COLOURS!˚ÉAdded 2 api getTicket and Account Details and made Postgres's sql db locally to test the latency of code to 700ms online Postgres's server to offline 2ms Postgres's latency additionally added react email support to the api to ease the development process and designed OTP verification mail

Which apparently includes deleting the OpenXR Action Map, because for some reason if I ever had an OpenXR Action Map all of the controller functions would stop working, even if I mapped up all the buttons, they just wouldn't work...˚ŒToday, I got the main bulk of the project done - PARTICLE GEOMETRY!

Here's how it works:
Instead of storing particle positions in CPU arrays and updating them each frame, the positions are stored in a texture (one texel per particle). This texture holds the (x, y, z) position and a "life" value in RGBA channels.

Each frame, a fullscreen compute pass (a small quad render) reads the current texture and writes an updated texture, moving each particle by adding Perlin noise (for organic wandering). If a particle's life decays to zero, it resets to its original image-grid position. This all happens on the GPU in parallel.

When it's time to draw, the particle geometry is simple: one vertex per pixel, but no position data. Instead, each vertex carries a UV coordinate that points into the simulation texture. The vertex shader samples that texture to fetch the particle's current (x, y, z), transforms it to screen space, and scales the point size based on life. The fragment shader colors each point by sampling the original image using the per-pixel image UV. 

The result: thousands of points move smoothly via GPU simulation, each one retains its source pixel color, thus creating fluid motion.

That's it! ;)ÊBackend setup. vercel KV (redis) for storing daily challenges :3. 3 api routes: daily game, random, game and index with some information about project.

Full Changelog: https://github.com/TKanX/bio-forge/commits/v0.2.2˚GMap is now NOT limited to canvas size (mapsize actually works :D).
Sticky camera now works as well (in combination to the fix and slight rendering rework).

TODO:
-implement better rendering system (shouldn't be as difficult now)
-add UI (builder menu etc)
(that's all, I don't want to be too ambitious as last times  :D)ËI am gonna copy https://bymanu.me 's style and everything, but will change it to be more of my own. I did get Manu's permission before doing this don't worry! I've copied the CSS and intro section so far lol. I also wrote the README∑I improved theming on multiple places like api docs, extensions text etc. also setup tracking for the extensions tab, and now you guys have textures everywhere not plain bg's anymore!õI‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place for this, but does anyone want to collaborate on a project related to JavaScript, TypeScript, or web development?(Setting things up always takes for ever!ICreated basic player movemnt, tilemap and prepared game for next steps :)ÜSet up the initial dioxus project, Organized into rust modules and tried setting up a database and auth, which currently doesn't work.æ- Made the topbar look nicer
- Added an info button that opens another window showing information about the software
- Renamed "Task" to "Process" internally in the codebase and in the GUI˚I started working on the actual game playing screens, for now im just workign on the frontend and the looks of the page, i have the buttons and elements down for the settings, tmr im going to work on the actual functionality and what happens when you change the settings, ect.˚'wrote the pico_SDK_import.cmake! big shout out to reddit shich helped a ton with the algorithm! I hope this helps others bc now the whole sdk import algorihtm is compiled. This should be copy-pastable into other projects (assuming it works (it probbaly dosnt but debugging shouldnt be that bad))|Today I've added a tool for getting the current time. I've also updated the system prompt slightly to tweak the personality.«Just fixed and touched up media upload page. Can upload any YT link. Running my own server using Raspberry Pi and Supabase broadcasts so any user can use device to upload media to site via my server.˚whole ton of refactoring across the board
- decided to just use deecho+dereverb for the uvr model
- improved compatibility across os's (probably idk its untested)
- refactored ManualSorter so that the:
- u can now edit the transcripts using ur default editor
- begun work on the exporter and unchatgpting legacy code
- switched from using keyboard to using some weird ass os specific shit so u actually ahve to be tabbed in (epic idiocicy from me)

idk what to screenshot for the attachment icl
enjoy the very wip exporter code˚ïFinished the MoE implementation for Nous!! I now have to fix some dumahh shape bugs and some weird jit compilation errors, but it's going well! Next step is going to giving the model some insane parameter numbers (I'm looking for >=1bn), then training it. Not sure what monster GPU I'll need for that, but I'll manage! (Oh also don't worry about my memory pressure, just training a 2bn parameter model...)myet another devlog! this time, just added another screen and worked on some logging + configuration utilities˚\After about going through different iterations (also I haven't programmed for a while) I got a working well-enough version of the number generating part (with input), and I have started on making the part where you guess the number yourself. After that I might add a gui if I find out how to, and I will look to add an option to play against a bot.¯- Added a searchbar to the tasklist
- Added an update button (refreshing is a bit laggy because of the amount of tasks so i dont wanna automatically do it every few seconds, so i added a button for it)
- Nuking a process now updates the task list˚qCurrently in a very rudimentary state. The neural network works but still has quite a few kinks I need to iron out. Once it gets into a slightly more complete state it will be available at https://twig46.github.io/doggosim-v2. The main issue at the moment is that all the dogs end up hugging the walls or corners. This is due to the lack of randomization in their movement meaning that when they have no sensory input they have no reason to do anything but go in a straight line. I plan to fix this soon and at that point I will release the first public version. But, for now, feel free to check the source code on my Github.[You can now launch the application with a command (before you had to run a file manually) !ooh devloggggsss˚Added sticky camera (no menu yet - problems with inefficient rendering)

TODO:
- better rendering (idea is present, just needs to be done well)
- builder menu (just UI though)
- conveyor (belt) tile (logic :pray:)
- mining (at least a machine - player might be more difficult)iStarted work on the level editor for the game. It's gonna be pretty similar to Rain World's level editor.˚ÉImplemented Charlieplexing class. Animation and Frame. This was before time was even tracked. It should just light up some LEDs. The code was tested on an Arduino UNO, as it was the only available piece of hardware at that moment. Furthermore, 6 LEDs (meaning 3 pins) on the arduino were used. The reisistors used were 220 Ohm resistors, meaning the current for each LEDs was around 6mA.˚ZFlavortown Devlog ‚Äì Day 3 (25/12/25)

Status: Initial prototype complete, meeting primary requirements

Progress:

Finalized the core 3D rigid body simulation with quaternion-based attitude representation.

Implemented IMU simulation with noise and bias.

Integrated a Kalman filter for angular velocity estimation.

Developed hybrid PID + attitude controller loop.

Achieved stable attitude tracking under initial test scenarios.

Added torque and angular velocity constraints; noted that these limit the system artificially but maintain simulation stability.

Observations:

The system responds predictably to reference angular velocities and desired orientations.

The PID controller is functioning properly; torque outputs remain capped by design.

Attitude tracking shows smooth convergence toward the target quaternion, despite initial bias and noise.

Some ‚Äúclipping‚Äù of torque and omega_ref observed due to imposed limits; can be relaxed in future iterations.

Next Steps (future considerations, post-prototype):

Evaluate removal of torque/omega_ref limits to study natural system response.

Consider adding hydrodynamic/aerodynamic effects for drone/USV applications.

Explore Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing with real sensors or motors.

Document simulation framework for potential DIY drone and USV community usage.

Notes:

The platform is currently suitable for learning, prototyping, and controller testing, but not yet for full-scale real-world deployment.

Prototype satisfies initial design goals; development phase concluded for now.

End of Day 3 UpdateOWrite some broken code in an attempt to make key handling across mods smoother.Finally Got Tasks Working!˚óSo this is sadly a huge devlog, but i spent so long debugging the data packets :(

This devlog adds the following
- Generating chunks, trying to match minecraft's palette format (not very good at it but)
- Saving and loading chunks (with zlib compression, an 32x32 chunk region with only air is 2.8KiB)
- Sending chunk and light data to client (no light data for now, just sending zeroes)
Making the chunk packets work was an absolute pain as the packet documentation is kinda lacking on that front, but i ended up figuring it out after a long time.

For the next devlog im going to make sending actual blocks and just not air, which shouldnt be too hard.˚ESet up the 3D printer that had appeared from under the tree for some reason... 

I've decided to use a non connected rib system with a thickness gradient inside a silicone mold rather than using hinges because that was stupid and the silicone rubber would probably get into the hinges so hopefully something like this worksTimetable integration done!!!!n2 new final functions, starting to work on dictionary part, additions will still be made in the list functionsôI have been working on finishing the website. I made all of the icons for the other apps and finished the home page. Here is a picture of the bug tracker≈now I have got a good looking and minimal UI. It's dark mode forever (light mode users go delete yourself). Now I will focus on other pages like the analytics page, then I will work on the backend!|Exactly one hour later... This is tough, my first but not my last game. What was added? The gold miner animation (only? yes)`are ya feeling lucky?
same! here's a random project button located in gallery tab!!!!!!!!!!!!!!˚Ispent about an hour changing the model and stuff to be closer to what our artist/designer wanted. we ended up not doing it that way because the z-fighting caused by the glowmask requires some changes that make it look weird. heres a picture. the inside is glowing but i had to move that glowmask layer up a little so it looks susfdsfds%I've just finished doing my first bit˚ªUpdate-3: added a cool little loading animation....that took way tooo long istg, but yeah it works yay

I spent a lot of time just fixing stuff up (mainly because i had to add persistent memory)
Made the logic of the new greeting message a bit better

Now on to the main task, i have spent some time trying to get the marvel api work...the information comes through but it's not in a format that i want if that makes sense... And now if I'm going to send it to gemini anyways ..using only gemini would have worked much better but here we areüò≠
Anyways I'm committed to this bit, although no one would know if it uses gemini only or gemini+marvel api....yeah should've thought this out betterÖI continued implementing the pawn promotion feature I started in the past. Now pawns that reach the end of the board can be promoted.aI added the cat image, and background image to the game and started working on the log obstacles.íFinished the basics structure of the first page. Will need to make some more models for the page but i first want to get the basic structure done.˚^Wrote the CMakeLists.txt!

Something more I want to accomplish with this project is making hardware coding more accessible. To do this, I wrote comments under each line outlining what it does. I remember when I first got into hardware coding, it was challenging because you had to know a lot just to get started. I want to make that process easier.Added 6 new functionsÈAdded player movement (no sticky camera yet... :/)
=(movement both WASD & arrows)

TODO:
- add belt tile (sprite + hopefully logic)
- (hoping for) mining (player or machine*)
- items
*- building + menu for building blocks etc.These first 2 hours were just setting up the basics in the project, like loading a tilemap from the tiled map editor into the game from different layers and rendering them correctly. Next thing to do is creating basic collision and physics.˚I added a statistics section at the top of the subscriptions page that tells you how much you're spending across your services per month and per year, with the total number of subscriptions. Also, I finally spent time to actually learn Markdown, and with the help of GitHub README examples, I wrote the README file with a lot of sections and information about the app, how to set it up locally, and contribution guidelines. It genuinely looks pretty professional. Also fixed some bugs and improved backend performance.iBuilt an basic landing page after struggling with NextJS. Looks ugly rn, but I promise it will get better˚Took me wayyy too long for these commits
I wanted to add creating assignments in the db, but I wanted to use the "offical" way.
So I look at the Nuxt UI docs and see that they provide a date picker
But that date picker uses a custom thing (`new CalendarDate()`) so it doesn't work with the `UForm` and Zod
So I had to go figure out a way to get around that
I settled on using 2 separate variables instead of putting it in the Zod schema the `UForm` uses


And I also got this "SQLITE_ERROR: no such column: users.id" error with Drizzle that took forever to fix
Turns out I was referencing the "users" table when I shouldn't have

There was also this "RangeError: The status provided (0) must be 101 or in the range of [200, 599]" error that I had to fix
But the status I was trying to return was 201 so that made no sense
I eventually narrowed it down to my `authentication` middleware
I forgot to use `await` when I called `next()` but now I fixed it

Added features:
You can created assignments in the frontend now :D˚ﬁI am trying to make the AI not forgot everything so I need to create a list of what happened before and what it said. But that is a list of the previous messages, and its hard to then tell it exactly what to remember and what not.  I am also getting can't append a list to str errors, so my biggest problem is memory. So I need to fix its memory. Hopefully it recovers, but I do have an excerpt of a storyline generated - you can tell that it can't remember what happened first.˚πTL:DR: Implemented dynamic command handling and pet care. Next step is hooking some LEDs, buttons and an LCD to stop using the serial console for everything

I implemented command handling in a way I didn't think was possible before. Initially I was planning to just make a switch statement to handle commands but then I had a stroke of genius and decided to try and implement a dynamic way to store functions in a command:function kind of way. I achieved that with a struct, which I only knew about from lessons about pointers in school and all I did was basically copy-paste code, so I didn't really know how to use it (until now).
I also created a way to actually take care of the pet. Now every time you feed it, its hunger will go down and when you play with it its happiness will go up.
Next I'm planning to maybe use an LCD, some LEDs and some buttons to stop using the serial console. I'd much rather use an OLED but it hasn't arrived yet :(&Now you can select an object and play.˚ÊHello,
I added account creating with for me cool flip animation for changing the login/signup form.
Then when loged(every time when the user enter the pages it checks, for security) its has now 3 pages, for now only settings has something.
I try to made as smooth as possible the appearing content animation, let me know if you love it.
Also in the video the animations is a lil chopy, but they are more smooth rl. Next time I will post a demo for you to try it!
That's it for now.VImproved defense system, introduction of building life, and introduction of resources./Made some basic error and language boilerplate.Lproject! This is so exciting. I can't wait to share more updates as I build.=initial creation of the lil goober
(literal menace incoming)!Added a functional "copy" button!OCant seem to solve this wierd bug where the tasks from the tasklist disappears!)Scrolling shenanigans have been achieved!˚~The game now actually opens a window AND renders tiles, no player yet :/... Tweaked the random algorithm to spawn the tiles more nicely, but I'm hoping to use perlin noise in the future instead :D!

Added some more sprites (specifically player sprite - moving and not)

TODO:  (hopefully next devlog)
- add player to scene
- let player move
- add belt tile (sprite AND logic)òMade a simple working version.
Now, it uses a simple encryption to prevent saving the message as plain text (the key is saved in the same directory XD)˚•Here were the things I did for the past two hours:
- Repositioned RP2040, crystal, and flash storage. Eventually, I flipped them to the front cuz it's just cooler. Imagine if you can see all the internals you're typing lol
- Move each row of diodes up to avoid unnecessary intersections
- Started routing, connected rows and columns and wired up USB port data traces
- Added copper zones and spread out the components”Added a section to display the technologies I know, use, and love. Has a cool hover affect that displays the tech logo in full color and adds a glow to the border in the accent color. Used devicon for the icons.˚5Merry Christmas guys! In this update, I added backend API endpoints for storing your subscription data to the database everytime you add, edit, or delete a subscription so your data is synced and backed up everywhere. I also added an option to change your account display name and improved some backend logic.˚›firsr devlog 
i am trying to see how far i can get with just using vanilla html, css and js.
so far i have added
a working header, responsive(i hope thats what its called) highlights on the buttons in the header
a colour scheme i was interested in (i spent like a LOTTA time on this I AM BAD AT COLOURS & STUFF)
since the website is a test for what I can DO, its going to be filled with memes, from gacha games(my guilty pleasure) to inside jokes that no one will get T_T.iI added comments to better understand the code and I changed the colors that I never heard or seen beforeïMade a really simple removal script utilizing a barcode reader (don't ask why I have one). What took so long? I'm working on a timetable integration.|removing placeholders from press and notice page. It's really annoying tho cuz the official page also has many placeholders.˚$Last step!
---
A lot of progress for only 36min of work. But, I changed the UI to be more "modern" or "pretty".
Added a system prompt when you have no messages (and hide it)
Added the onClick function for the reset button (now it works)

Working on the final README and ready to ship!!!%Attempting some tiling shenanigans :pi optimized some functions :3YI'm glad I decided to make unit tests. I caught a subtle bug before pushing to crates.io.]made the search bar , completed the todo UI and added some keybinds to select input box fast.]made the search bar , completed the todo UI and added some keybinds to select input box fast.&This mainly, progress with time calcs,Very very simple main menuUA lot of networking has been done to make everything publicly accessible (first time)Bug fixing again‰Just completed the core backend. NOw i think ill work on frontend. Also got a potato png form internet. CLeared its background and imported in vscode. Now i think i should make a cozy background like the flavortown has for this.˚XThere is an AI now!!
---
From last devlog, I implemented AI (with session history) and changed the UI acording with feedback.
History is fully local and it's saved on session storage, so, when you close the browser, the chat clears. Also, the UI isn't the best, it's just for testing, I will be trying new styles after this and then ship it.8Working typing test! With random quotes in the terminal!˚“Fable Friend is actually interacting like a dungeon master. I updated Fable Friend to behave more like a real storyteller and I gave it a memory, so it does not forget its entire conversation immediately. I have a state - which is just a container that the AI sees. And I have the situation that the user is in on that state, I also tested the memory which summarizes previous interactions. Next, I need to link everything together better and ensure a better prompt.õmade an initial design of the website.
it does not look good like a portfolio website so still going to refine it further to look more like stock website.uNew version of model with enhanced feature set is being gpu-trained right now. 
Will take around 2 days to complete.˚8First Dev update! :) 

I officially made version two of Hexee. Version 1 was made over a year ago, so it was time for an update. This update features a working picker, display, and cool color changing side. The copy code button doesn't work yet though! Total time was 30 minutes EXACTLY. (which is pretty cool)sAdded a storage section to the GUI showing storage devices and the space used/availble and their total storage size˜Also replaced HTML's checkbox element with my own custom component now so I can style it properly. Also added pointer cursors to make the UX a bit more intuitive. Next I'm probably gonna add the ability to remove colors (and reorder them maybe? :3Added some final touches˚SI finally placed every down in suitable positions (hopefully we'll see when we get to routing
I also changed all the diodes from SMD to THT so that I don't need to use via everywhere, and I could literally just trace either horizontally or vertically anyway I want

Question: Should I place USB port on top right corner or bottom right?ólearned how to get data from my crypto miner and send a msg to slack via slack webhook api 


https://docs.slack.dev/tools/python-slack-sdk/webhook/ÙWe‚Äôve all stared at a blank Instagram or LinkedIn profile, wondering what to write. I wanted to build a tool that solves "writer's block" for social media. The goal was simple: Input a topic, get a creative bio or trending hashtags instantly.ÅI am currently working on expiry watchdogs that my live project in that im just integrating some features to get it more advancedÅI am currently working on expiry watchdogs that my live project in that im just integrating some features to get it more advancedÎJust started the project, got a few things working. So far we have the basic layout of the website, tabs, a section of CTF writeup that renders markdown files, a project section that hasn't been filled in, and a sick loading animation.0Added three core modules
More, soon to come >:3˚Added login and register
Frontend now logs in automatically :D

Editor changes (indent 2 spaces -> indent 4 spaces)
Ignore the sqlite db when pushing to git
Changed 'name' in the schema to 'username'

Next up: creating assignments and viewing assignments£A Lot of tweaks of styles and the codebase including moving the usage meter section into a better looking "box" and moved them into their own file for organization!still learning glfw+opengl3+imguibnow uses hack club api instead, and use yolo with ocr to extract instead of feeding straight away.îFront-end almost finished, it has a look I like and there is only a few touches left to do. After this, I will start to add the backend and ship it!˚_Today I fixed multiple issues in my project Student Productivity Hub related to file naming and linking. Initially, my CSS and JavaScript were not loading correctly because of incorrect file extensions and opening the wrong HTML file.

I used the browser console to debug errors and learned how important correct file names and paths are in web development. After fixing these issues, my CSS styling appeared correctly and the study timer and task list started working as expected.

This step helped me understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript connect together and how to debug common beginner mistakes.˚_I created some figma designs for the app and I have began working on the app itself. I am making it in C#. I will try to first get the app to read XInput and DInput first then get it to translate to each other before working on everything else such as major UI designs. Unlike the last project, I know C# so this shouldn't be as hard as the other app.˚AHHHH THE MOST ANNOYING PART, here were the things I was trying to do:
- Place all the components in suitable positions
- Calculate the width of D+ and D- for USB
- Find tutorials to make sure everything is alright

Trust me patience is the secret sauce!!˚ëUpdate-2: the chat screen boots up, you would be talking to dormamu (cus he's cool) and you'll be doctor strange (idk but feels right)
i have made the ui, things show up on screen, 
also also made it so it has 2 cool greetings when it pops up
now have to make the actual chat part
i am thinking about smth like taking data from the marvel api then feeding it into gemini to make the reply sort of cool

also need to implement something like keyword parsing so tony stark, tony, iron man and words similar to it give same results
ig i'll do a manual map for now ...only if the marvel api was not this specific with its endpoints :(
also another cool piece of lore
darkhold is a book which grants the user imense power but it takes control of the soul (ie corrupts the user...dr strange uses it in one of the comics and also in marvel what if to try to bring back her ded wife..but since that is an essential point in time, it cannot be reversed
dr strange becomes the supreme dr strange after consuming every creature of the darkhold and tries every possibility but is unable to bring back her wife....so on paper strange consults the darkhold..but not dormamu but i found it funny lol so made dormamu the holder of darkhold for no reason.ok enough of this ..gonna go back to implement a load screen or some shi and hope no errors pop up
like it already takes 10 mins to compile and run everytime i'll go insane ugh˚Nok because of hackatime update delay this devlog covers a lot of things:
1) I added verification support
2) Made it an image of text not just text, it is compressed using zlib and its 1-bit
3) Improved the noise generation, it now uses a more advanced 2D markov chain

In the video, you can notice:
1) The noise has more "structure" to it than before. This is what the upgraded 2D markov chain is doing, and it makes it harder for ML models to recognize the decoys
2) The text is actually an image of text, notice the border around it and the pixelation.
3) I can click "submit" nowKSet up the libraries and the oled display and drew one rectangle to test it˚sChemistry and Physics simulations have been DESTROYED! (completed). I can't think of Biology simulation but THEN, @cyteon from Slack, suggested evolution simulator. Which is pretty cool BUT I will be working on that tomorrow. 

So here is what is by me DESTROYED thus far:
- Chemistry simulations (3 out of 3)
- Physics simulations (3 out of 3)

AND here is what is left:
- Biology simulations (all)
- Changing the UI
- Adding sound effects

Challenges? I feel bio sims are going to be more complex  and also I need to revamp the UI so it might take more time tomorrow. HOPEFULLY I complete this project by tomorrow.~Done with all the upgrades after a good amount of research, and the final game is playable with faster and even faster cars...˙I changed the name of the project and with that I had to change most of the file import definitions in go with the new ones. Along with that I wrote the test run file which allows the user to quick test the project with testcases (expected and input)LA game that I have always wanted to play with, but it was never made before.Mcrazy hardware stuff completed connection btw aman os and aman weather systemyMerry Christmas, and happy holidays! Added some more features, but today will probably be a slow day (busy eating turkey)DFinished adding new features to the customer and kitchen portal/menubAdded more detail into cpu.py and memory.py so it can handle classic gameboy games such as tetris.˚Ï## Juicing things up
For the past 2 hours or so I've been working on juicing things up:
1. The board now slightly move and bounces around when you move the piece
2. There's particle when clearing lines
3. The board slightly tilt when you spin a piece (not to be confused with rotating! Search T-Spin on google or something for more details)

I also feel like now's a good time to yap a bit about what I want this game to be.
Basically, I love tetris, but now there's a skill gap between me and my friends so they no longer want to play with me :(. I want to create a Tetris party game that will be fun and balanced even if players have skill gap, and make it enjoyable for everyone.

I'll talk more about it in later devlogs. For now, cya!%REMOVED ask AI button in word details˚QLets goo
I got the websites page to work with ease, i didnt expect to finish it very fast. I did not want to make a dedicated javascript code for adding a website. Therefore i took the javascript code that i made for the to-dolist and changed the names of the id's. Now the websites have their own place where they are stored locally :D˚hI made it so nodes sync the blockchain on startup. Also, they exchange their public keys when they connect, I'll use this to implement de-duplication of connections later! (I ran into a bug when implementing peer discovery where a node would just repeatedly connect to itself)

I know the demo isn't very exciting but it shows the nodes connecting, exchanging keys, and syncing the blockchain.

Next is peer discovery!

Oh, I should also make the difficulty change dynamically and probably clean up the code a bit and maybe actually make it so transactions can be created through the cli, that seems important.nCoded the functionality of the text cleaner and styled it a little bit to match to color theme of the website.GFull working, now setting up cloudflare tunnel (do not want open ports)˚LTook a lot longer than I would've hoped (went from planning only 2 hours to 12). I added in the README with build instructions and there is a release apk file there if you don't want to get your own API keys. I wasn't able to build an ipa since my macbook is an old 2012 one running OCLP so it's really slow. But I did use flutter so it shouldn't matter too much. I did use a bit of VSCode Copilot for writing the README and some of the spotifyservice file because that was genuienly a nightmare but I did pretty much all of the code except for maybe a total of 50 lines in that one file.˚Ofeat: Implement student and teacher calendar pages with event handling and custom badges
- Added StudentCalendarPage component for students to view calendar and events.
- Added TeacherCalendarPage component for teachers to view calendar and events.
- Integrated calendar day configuration and event fetching using react-query.
- Implemented event icons and badges for different day types (working, holiday, half-day).
- Created responsive calendar grid with navigation for month selection.
- Added upcoming events section with event details dialog for both student and teacher portals.soo i add some moree•I have added a GET reqest which serves file. it can serve a file saved in the upload folder.
Now im implementing a POST request to upload files in the upload folder˚vIn this project, I am developing a browser-based reminder extension designed to help users manage their daily tasks and deadlines more effectively. The extension allows users to quickly add reminders, set specific times, and receive notifications without leaving the browser.

My main focus is on creating a clean, user-friendly interface with smooth performance and reliable alerts. During development, I worked on improving task storage, notification accuracy, and overall usability to ensure the extension feels simple yet powerful. Future updates will aim to add more customization options and productivity-focused features.Im learning KiCad rn :DeDone with the js work of one file one more to go for the main physics now done with the functionality˚ŒI added a tracking system where you can see how long people have been watching to the site together ,how many fireworks did go off in that time and how much all that fire work costed if it were real firework. I made this using Supbase. I also improved the performance off the site by removing some glow and trails (sadly). Lastly I added mobile support, now you can watch the countdown on your phone.

Yep, that's right. I spent 5.2 hours making a Tetris engine. Please trust me that it's worth it, though, and no, this is not my first time using Godot.

You see, while Tetris is a popular simple beginner project with tons of tutorials, most of them implements it 'incorrectly'. There's actually standards on what Tetris is, including rotation system, kick table, bag system, piece spawn position/orientation etc, which allows for crazily fast Tetris. Most tutorials just go as far as 'blocks fall and when line full clear line', but that's not enough for me.

Here's what I've done:
- A skin system fully compatible with [TETR.IO Plus Skin](https://you.have.fail/tetrioplus/)
- A lore accurate implementation of the popular SRS+ kick table
- Configurable DAS and ARR
- A 7 bag implementation

The engine I've created is exteremly module, you can swap rotation system or throw some pentrominos at the player and it won't complain. 

Here's a video of it! (I'm an S+ player on tetr.io, btw :D)˙worked on some suggestions by @The-Wolf ,

Next, I want to make a snake game.i am working on rasting appûAlthough the interface has been implemented, there is a bug where the shutdown screen does not appear after installation completes, requiring manual shutdown.˚äManaged to take an image, and split it up into particles, and started on the particle geometry. Right now, I've only got each particle vibrate slightly.

Here's how it works:
I treated the image (scaled down for performance) as a grid of pixels, and created one point per pixel. For each pixel, a 2D position is calculated on a normalised plane where x,y ‚àà [-0.5, 0.5] and z = 0. 
FOR EACH POINT, I store:
a) an image UV pointing back to that pixel, so I can fetch its colour later
b) a size multiplier
c) a UV into a simulation texture that holds the particles position
This allows for more GPU-friendly play. During rendering, the vertex shader samples the simulation texture using the per-point UV to get the current position, and the fragment shader samples the image using the image UV to colour the point, so the original picture appears as a cloud of coloured particles. Ta-da

Thats it!˚UToday I started working on my project called Student Productivity Hub. I planned the features of the website, including a study timer, task list, exam countdown, and motivational quotes.

i realized that, before rendering, i should make some sort of asset management. i went sort of overkill and created a ref-counted cached resource management system, but it's actually pretty simple. there's a ResourceManager, which is exposed to the api. ResourceManager can register ResourceLoaders (load and sizeOf), and then, using ResourceManager.load(path), users can load a resource after registering a loader for that type of resource. i only made TextResourceLoader so far, but i plan to implement binary, images, and possibly compiled shaders (but idk yet). i also still need to make it async, but kotlin has pretty good async capabilities, so i'm not too worried.˚˛ Just completed my portfolio website with 3d elements added a red bob which acts as a scrollbar.

This took SUCH little time that I'm expanding the project. The goal now:
Full discord bot with a custom economy system (you spin wheel, complete quest, get reward) some simple moderation tools that I would actually use, this feature, the ability to add your own help articles (like how to connect to YOUR SPECIFIC minecraft server or something) and modular design so that I could add plug in support.

I think making a visual installer would be cool, but that would be impossible because:
- you need to set up a discord bot, something that can't be done with an API (to prevent abuse)
- you need to set up OAuth and a google API project, as well as the "test account" as the code reciever.
If you set both those up, the only thing left is moving the creds file and token into creds.json and .env so there's no point to have an installer. (I will make a better README due to the required complexity to set up.

I spent some time on trying to make typos work(you typed wrong letter so you delete it and replace) but this doesn't work because then the program uses wrong rotor positions (and this is historical, no way to fix it). Theoretically you could turn the rotor BACK by how much they delete but that's just not worth it. If you can't type that's a u problem. Also, instead of using the plaintext itself as a queue and removing from it, i am using a position variable that indicates up till where you have calculated the ciphertext till. This way you can still see the plaintext when you copy the ciphertext.£made the colors correct every time! if a same letter was present multiple times, it could end up showing the wrong colors leading to misunderstandings of the game.made scp 173Working usage metersΩMany more bugs!!!

This is a port of an app I made a few years ago to next.js so it is deployable. This is a simple (or complex, depending on how you look at it) citation machine. It is powered by 5 different services in the backend: chegg, mybib, readability, hackclub ai, and my own parser. They all work together to ensure credibility and correctness in citations based on a URL. Wait? AI? Doesn't that hallucinate????!?!?! No. Not the way I did it. The model is constrained to a specific schema and will only change things if most of the previous sources disagree on eachother (old data from a random API is *usually* less reliable than data scraped off the page by an LLM).

it works in a very cool way too, it moves diagonally and every step takes a random chance to decide whether or not to flip the x direction. the chance is parameterized as well, which means i can easily change the jaggedness in the future!Zwhy are gov websites so cluttered and hard to navigate?? so tried to make it a lil easier.zkitchen is now useful, because be real after steps/tutorial it is worthless so.. made is useful as a quick overview glanceoi added a level builder to build and render a background as well as setting up basic skeletons for game scenes.More bug fixing.......`Started the configuration items in the achievement editor, though it definitely needs more work.˚VFurther work! We can now parse bold text, italics, strikethrough, code blocks, lists, etc.

I'm thinking I'll start figuring out some way to automatically generate documentation from the LISP code I'll be writing for my other project, or some separate file containing function descriptions... Or maybe it'll just all be markdown. Who knows!˚rSkipped a day because of Christmas dinner prep. Am I almost done? Continued fixing bugs but decided to quit. They were hiding too well. Added a function to proofread instead. That‚Äôs what authors do, and probably what I should be doing for my English assignments. Except now it‚Äôs making more mistakes than it‚Äôs fixing. I need an editor‚Ä¶ for my editor function. :(vRestructuring, improving readme, general QOL things. Not much. Also added pytest tests to find out when I break thingsCsuccessfully setup project structure and made first functional itemKI am redoing this project with different things
Here is a pic of it so farLA website to teach people what e=mc^2 even is and what the purpose of it is.(Fixed api key reroll button to be white.˚ÍSo it's my first time working with either Go or Qt so it'll be a slow start to the progress logs I'm sure. Right now i want to focus on getting a decent looking UI, along with some static system information. I've implemented a bit of code which fetches basic CPU information on MacOS, and I've also created a custom widget which creates an image with a border around it.

Next up is probably to display the CPU info I fetched, along with other stuff like memory and storage configuration.7Add the connection to the AHK backend from the Win 3 UI>I forgot to add crash report parsing to forge. oops. done that⁄Created a new react native expo project, added in nativewind, and created a basic grid for how I will want the widgets to be placed. Next I'll need to make each widget component based and start populating it with data.¶For the past hour, I have been wiring my keyboard and I gotta be honest it was much easier than an RP2040 dev-board as there was much more space. Enjoy the process!!!—implemented a pretty rough timer to keep track of time, also is my first time noty only developing a extension but also using ts so its being a little hard

yet it is pretty funny and I feel like im learning˚˚ added some blessing text that scrolls and a cool little circle that breathes to give this demo some fresh air :D
should be the last few things!! super happy on how it turned out! the code's a bit messy but it's my first handling tick time management.<setting up project structure and experimenting adding  items˚Add 'https://hackclub.com/' to the default list of seed URLs. We are currently loading 73575 sites. I also added a logger library to replace all my System.out.println calls. Next, I will add support for hovering over sites and displaying data about that site.dWe've got a kind of TUI?

It scales with the terminal window, dynamic, very cool

< ANSIPIXELS 3˚IThis project is pretty research heavy, so I researched a bit online and accordingly designed the file structure.

I also finished writing the code for the api request part. It can now successfully connect to 2 external databases and 1 local one!

I also need to learn about sqlite because this plays a key role in my project.˚I added a second lip on the holders to prevent vertical motion. I still need to figure out how to prevent them from moving forward when the roadcase is being closed. I also added slots for 10-32 locknuts. This will make assembly easier, as well as make the overall package smaller.˚˘Ok so I finally got back to this project! After HCAI came back online I did some tweaks. Firstly, since nest got abandoned, I switched the DB to use Neon! I could NOT upgrade to AI@6 since the openrouter sdk is behind on it, but I will look into upgrading once they do. I also did everything listed below:

fix: open search citations in a new tabimplemented a mood pickerﬂIt's been almost two hours since the last devlog... who would have thought that preventing players from placing buildings on top of each other would be so difficult? (I still haven't fixed it) but now it's running smoothly.˚PAddressing my comment on the previous devlog:
I've switched my collision detection model from AABB to OBB (Oriented Bounding Box), which takes into account the rotation of the objects and, by extension, the rotation of the collider itself.

I was trying an approach where I was doing a ton of math to recreate the position of each of the points of the OBB individually, but that didn't really work well with rotations, especially along the X-Axis (no idea what that was). So instead, I just used a model matrix and did some basic transformations on that, and it worked basically first try.XI completed the key layout and also decided to move all the diodes and parts to the back@Added a GitHub Actions for building the app and lint/formatting.·added the Christmas lights as well as snowflake particles! took some time since i'm challenging myself to try to write actual good variable names lol.. 

all i'm missing now is some text and a slightly cool effect in there.@I am still trying to make this work but I added my image in HTMLhA total of 7h spent on this project is crazy bro (I realized smth and started counting mid project üíÄ)õAdded cats powerups, they will give you a speed boost for 8 seconds when you collect one!
Added stats like rain spawning interval and cats collected

I literally spent 21 minutes just trying to get apiKeys to be persistant in the docker containuer using docker volumes i hate docker NOW ITS PRODTATO READYòSet up player data and achievement incrementation. Also made the logic to replicate the player data back to the database in the `anc_progressions` table˚^Taro is my attempt at building the coolest AI project ever that makes you feel like we're living in the future. I really think AI has got a huge potential, but right now it's hard to integrate it into our daily lives to automate our day to day tasks. My goal is to build a system that understands your context and intentions to solve problems and automate tasks.

Taro is being built on top of OpenCode, which provides the foundations for agentic AI, including tools and skills. However, I plan on extending its capabilities by making the AI be able to have initiative when certain events are triggered. I also plan on making a cross-platform client for using it from anywhere.

The main component of the system is skills. Skills load context on a specific domain, and they include workflows, which instruct the AI on how to perform a task achieve a specific result. This is huge because you can create deep context on how you want the AI to do things and have it only load the context when needed.

For now I've been experimenting with OpenCode and creating my first tools and skills. I've coded a tool for getting YouTube transcripts and another for getting transcripts from images and documents. For now, I'm going to work on making more tools and skills to solve not only problems that I have but for general tasks as well that I think could help for other people.˚ÑI upgraded the player character. There was a problem where I was using the CastRayClosest function in Box2D incorrectly by assuming the second argument was a vector that was the end of the ray but it was actually a direction and magnitude for the ray to go in and so it fixed my problem that the endpoints of the legs were drifting left or right. I also made the legs overshoot to maintain balance. I also changed the IK solver to have a pole vector so the legs always bend outwards making it look a lot more natural. I also made it so the legs hover in mid air when you're not grounded but it looks a bit silly since I didn't code it properly.™Reorganized this, so that there isnt 3 rows per vote, instead its cleaner with just 1 row per vote, also themed this table. also comments are now differentiated in themes,Make a new and more modern UI using Win UI 3˚Shipped a modular status page editor: Felte handling forms, Zod guarding inputs, and a reusable delete dialog for dramatic exits.

This fixes lots of 'deep' sites never getting crawled.  We phazin in the bih.1Added features such as dragging, moving and turnsAFixed even more bugs, primely build errors but also still backendKMade the base of the page. Styling is still off. Notch preview is horrible.˚wAdded index, signun, login, the actual app, signout, as well as working on profile!

The index.html, is very bare bones because I didn't really like the idea of just having a blank screen as a home page while I was working on the backend and deep web part of this project.

Signup, uses firebase auth, email, username, password, and also, you can signup with google!

Login, same as signup but different :)

app, this uses bootstrap tables to do it as well as placeholders. (You should see for yourself)

profile/settings, basically your email, if you want to add a password since users who signed up with google should have the ability to add their password. Thats all i have for this page but I will add delete account, delete password, delete google verification (u have to have a password), change password, and change email.

signout, well, as the name sugessts signout!I balanced some itemséI finished setting up the hands and the system to play again if the user wants to. I made a mistake midway and had to redo a lot of it though.\Started working on the frontend part of the project by using streamlit + importing CSS :))))Add more ASCII!!!˚After fooling around a ton with UI and breaking my app about 20 times, I have finally decided to let clanker ai cook a bit. Also I improved the prompt that's give to the AI, so that it doesn't ONLY spam insults. I think I am finished and start deploying to prod!?Still working on the construction system... It's lagging a lot.˚?Starting point for this log:
The site is vanilla html, css, and js, but comes with an npm/vite setup for development. Most functionality technically works but there are some errors with the microphone usage and it doesn't yet support actual fabrication of the stickers. Still trying to figure that out.
This is effectively just a generated framework for me to work on.

Updates:
- mic stuff hopefully fixed + formatting consistency
- litterbox broken... need to solve that + add backup
- odd bug noticed where nanobanana ignored the input image and just made a new one˚˙I have been working on this fun project for quite some time and right now I have quite a lot down already, 
The basic frontend (really badly designed, just a placeholder for now)
The general signing up/in system, and the shelf directory.

I really just spent the last 2 hours fixing bugs and finishing the campfire and shelf pages. The community page is still a placeholder for now (It will be for getting friends etc.)

PS this is something I have been working on before working on it for FlavortownxSo i added the generation of a grid of any size, I will later use this system to remove boxes using DFS and make a maze.ïI added a top bar and then fixed all the bugs that came with the top bar ugh. Next up: filtering the vector tiles by date, if I don't get distracted.˚
Based off the experience from the two previous projects im finally now working on a full-size keyboard with integrated RP2040!! I just copied and pasted my my schematic from RP2040 and made some modifications specifically for keyboard, and I also mapped key switchesSFinished the sword throw animations and made the sword throw trajectory prediction.∫Woah fast fix too i swapped it to use api key instead sas the prefix only allowing 1 api key to be used for a channel but a channe4l can have multiple projects subscribed so yipeeeeeeeeeÂI'm working on my first project!

I uploaded the same video as for the frontend, because, again, that's how you can see them in action!5Made the Basic OpenGL program which starts an window.˚ˇ Started the project. It currently can recursively scan through a webpage tree and download all files/routes it finds. Has simple deduplication. Currently, there is no file structure.

All file names, hashes and locations are stored in a sqlite database.˚oAlright, so I worked a little bit, made the code more usable and understandable (for both me and you), and added these quick commands tool you can see in the video, they just start and stop the server (and restart, ofc). Now I think I want to figure out how to structure the page, because you can only fit so many elements on a page and it has to be pretty organized.˚AWoah this was a fast devlog i made /logpheus-remove so you can now remove your project from a channel! and i also realised im an idiot! i now gotta modify the code to not use project id as a prefix and instead use channel id so someone cant block you from adding your proj to your channel because they added it to theres!˚WHi, this is the initial devlog for my personal portfolio site. This will be my first experience working with three.js, which is a library made for displaying 3d graphics in a web interface. Currently i have created the main hero section of my home page, which comprises of a glass effect model of my logo in front of a triad of spinning rings.√I implemented Schrodinger's Equation in a compute shader :). From here, I want to add functionality to define the potential energy function and boundaries to further manipulate the wave function.˚1Split this project from my main one, GameLISP. It's a basic documentation generator which converts .md files to .html. Currently, headings are working, but the rest won't be too difficult to do :-D

Here's the TKinter frontend, and a side-by-side comparison of the original file and the generated one...˚"Date: December 24
Status: Stable simulation, development pause

Objective

Validate the inertial control loop behavior in a fully simulated environment before introducing sensor imperfections and model uncertainty.

The focus was on:

Angular velocity convergence

Torque behavior at equilibrium

Structural correctness of the control loop

Observations

During the final simulation steps (140‚Äì190), the system consistently reported:

Angular velocity equal to the setpoint

Zero applied torque

No oscillation or drift

This indicates:

Proper convergence of the controller

Stable equilibrium

No residual control effort once the target state is reached

From a control-theory standpoint, this is the expected outcome in an idealized model.

Merry Christmas guys!˚vFinally I Become abled to setup my Project in windows and Linux (The Worst Things Started after that). Then I Learned I will have to manage all the Buffers which needed to send to the Gpu and I also need to Create Vertex Shaders and Fragment Shaders from myself to render anything. Then I got some (actually a lot) of errors which Cooked my Brain for most Days. Then I Decided to Retry and Finally after 3 hours of coding and neary 5 hours (actually more) of really articles (I did not watched tutorials or used ai) I finally become abled to render a single Triangle. Now I will try to Increase the Speed of Development in future./Fixed some more bugs, primely with the backend.≈The past hour I have been debugging and making the bot worked implementing /logpheus-add to add projects to the list and it works i just need to add /logpheus-remove now :3c and also docker support˚
Finished the repo! It's based around Upptime, but I had to modify pretty much every part of every repo for it to be able to work with my modifications. I completely redesigned how it looks, improved the READMEs, republished all packages... I must say, it looks fire!I create a portfolio.cleared few bugs in aman os€I got a basic UI ready! I spent like 20mins on this thing and then it wasn't working...I see the logs. Turns out I was having an server error and nothing was wrong with frontend.

who doesn't like wordle? (I do cause I suck at guessing words aaa-)˚,I‚Äôve updated the Art II and III pages to use a subpage layout for better spacing and readability. On the Art III Drawing and Painting pages, I added logos and overlay headers to give each section more personality and context. I also reorganized the artwork into separate folders for drawings and paintings, added new pieces like pencil vases and acrylic portraits, and redesigned the galleries with a masonry-style column layout. Also, to make these more, say, "alive", I added scroll-fade overlays and fade-in animations for images as they appear on screen. The social carousel and other scripts now run safely across all pages, and hover effects on images have been refined for smoother interactivity. Next I'll keep adding more pieces once I take better images of them, rn the lighting's not top quality lol=I have completed the user endpoints, working on the entry oneˆI restarted this website. I recently made a shared library with all of the shared components. The old version of this website was so out of date I just copied The House App Website because they share many parts. This is a picture of the home page˚˚ - Editable iteration and zoom speed

All of the rendering is also now no longer hard coded so the dimensions of the viewer can be whatever
Dynamic detail option that turns up the iterations as you zoom inFinally got the hang of json˚ÜMade detectors for both fabric and quilt crash reports, and got the same basic data as the regular logs. I had to change how the files are loaded and passed in the main script, because it was causing the line numbers to be off by one for some reason. Just closed and reopened the files and it works now. I also had to change the initial file extension regex, because it didn't work properly`Overcooked theme, skip button for votes, and a support for sidebar pinning even on small screens˚ïI worked on making a function to automatically add all the event listeners for the toggles automatically. That was a major pain. also spent a bunch of time figuring out what map layers I actually need. Currently the map tiles show all the data from all of time, and the slider doesn't work. I'm going to work on that today. I figured out how to customize all the layers on the map too with the style JSON.+Made a super short readme for this project.˚¶Ok, so I tried to make the server use the WebSocket connection to send, in realtime, the output of the minecraft servers, but apparently, on windows, java sends the output slower when it detects that it is being run in a subprocess, and I tried to make it instant, but I couldn't figure it out, so im gonna work on other features next such as basic turning on and off the server, etc... and ill focus on the console later.hCurrently make image processing and upload work. Also changing reader to fit processer.
(Not done yet.)+Made a super short readme for this project.Added basic LCD support™I know this looks very silly, it does ;-;

I've added a "grace" system: when you touch a wall or your own tail, you get a short grace period to recover before it's game over. I've also made the game's animation super smooth thanks to a new way of handling the main loop. The neon effects, particles, and vibrations make the game feel more alive. Finally, everything is playable with the option to turn music and sound effects on or off.6Designed the frontend of the sign in and sign up pages˚·I successfully compiled the full application, and I am happy to confirm that it is stable and functioning as expected. It's in the final stages of preparation and will be publishing the first version very soon.

3D Customization Enhancements. In preparation for this release, I have refined and fixed several customization options to give users greater control over 3D scene rendering. You can now reliably configure the following parameters:
- Shadow Settings: shadowBias, shadowMapSizeWidth, and shadowMapSizeHeight
- Lighting: light source type
- Interaction: enableIdleRotation and enableMouseAttraction

I will include an example configuration file with the release to demonstrate exactly how to utilize these new parameters.˚qI need a devlog to test so uhm past hour and half i well made lib file for ft its a class file so i can use it in other projects if i want to too then using that i made it pull projects then pull devlogs if no cache file exists it adds all devlogs of project id which is in apiKeys.json which stores project id as key then under it the api key and channel to post it to˚)I started a new  project!

Today I revisited a project I abandoned 2 months ago.

Back then, I wanted a music player that has yt-dlp features, and I wanted it quick. So I used Copilot a lot to quickly make it. It worked for a while, but one day it didn't.

Since it's winter vacation now, I have more time to actually make it elegant.
So today I mainly focused on refactoring and cleaning up the awful code me and copilot wrote 2 months ago. I think that's how it's going to be for this week. Next week, I'll work on improving the UX and stuff.VI worked on the HTML today for the website. This is how the HTML looks like right now.˚Today I've routed the PCB.
It started with measuring the pitch between switches.
Next I set a custom grid to the measured pitch, which is 17.5mm.
It was routed without too much thought on MCU pins as all digital pins have the functions that I need. I firstly ordered them in order, which was a mistake.
Next was assingning the pins. And adding the two headers. I also had one header with spare GPIO but that would be too much hassle.

I'll bake it with my other PCB. I mean, etch it.
Then I'll code the code and integrate it.ûadded arrows with perfect-arrows, and added the option to edit the position of the start and end of the arrow, and also of a straightenend (stupid word) line.Zadded add link feature and added profile view as well to see user's pfp and personal info.wenhanced chat UI,

Essentially, it'll take the list of tokens and use that to build a stack which can be executed from. I was initially planning on some kind of LR parser but found that to be really difficult and honestly, recursive descent is good for 90% of grammars anyways. If it works for C++, it sure as hell will work for this.˚iMade the demo for the captcha. 
This is incredibly easy for humans, as we can "stop" mvoing the slider in real time. But for AI, you have to send a whopping 50 images to a multimodal (image supporting) AI model. Even using a light model like Gemini 3 Flash, it will take 27,225$ or 54,450 input tokens (equivalent to an 150 page book) and JUST TO CRACK ONE OF THESE! 
Oh, if you are thinking of pasting the ASCII text that wont work since the Markov Chain produces decoys that have the same local patterns as real ASCII text art and the AI gives answers all of the decoy texts, and even when its not a decoy its the  wrong answer. So without images AI can't "read" ASCII text art.
The "fake" ASCII arts are generated using a special markov chain algorithm (implemented in the previous devlog) that makes it harder for an ML model to recognize which text is the real one.˚iMade the demo for the captcha.

and even though the output quality would be slightly worse in edge cases, i took the lazy route. handle most cases, give good perf, keep codebase simple.˚ÿMore modifications to auth! This time not because slack sucks but because I wanted auto login. It now saves xoxd and xoxc in a json file with name scheme "slack-${user.name}.json" user,name being active system user so different system users dont got same file and don't worry it's encrypted with a key set in system keyring under that users account. The user account name is grabbed using a tauri command with using the rust crate "users' to get the active system account.Ftried new OCR technologies, but did not work. got back to tesseract.jsShow progress of each item using the bg, also sidebar pinning fixes for long names (im looking at gizzy), and some theme fixes.WThe bot will now automatically farm on its own.

The cool easter egg value I was putting into a reserved EXT4 OSVal2 var caused the whole thing to fail and caused some weird issues like corrupted creation time and corrupted ExtraBlocks. After I fixed that I realised that the InodeType Enums were wrong so I found the correct one from the [Gitlab Page](https://gitlab.incoresemi.com/software/linux/-/blob/0e698dfa282211e414076f9dc7e83c1c288314fd/Documentation/filesystems/ext4/inodes.rst#i-osd2) which helped me to enable Extents in my inode. After that I tested it with `debugfs` and it worked! Although List Dir Still doesnt work properly. Today added minor things.

i added metadata, fixed some height issues, added a hackclub banner, fixed an issue with an image. 

yeah thats all just minor things that change lots of things internally|Added Fridge Mode, which allows you or anyone to be able to search recipes just for main ingredients you have in the fridge!Fish :>Fixed C++ errors:Search!! Search any project you like, in the explore page.,Fixed a few bugs in the customer menu portalóOk I have finished this project!!! Now the AI can use the context of given images to edit them! Please check it out at: https://imago.ultimatedev.space˚2Yea, i think this is better, i changed the background by making a pattern using the css for the background, i also fixed the buttons or tabs which are in the middle of the scree, they could not allign well when they were independent. but i made a box for them and now they fit better in the screen content.˚ÇI've replaced the plain STT engine with MicroWakeWord as the WakeWord engine. It's more accurate, and prevents mis-detecting.
To train the model, you will first have to do "python setup.py", and then it will guide you through training the model. You can either record "Hey Piston" as the wakeword, or choose your own wakeword. Just record your desired wakeword as it prompts you to. 
Btw, don't start saying the wakeword until "üî¥ Recording... press ENTER to stop" pops up
And also, I've coded the script to abort the recognition when no one is talking. But if you said something, it would minus one in validCount, so the chat can go on.Ä[!] Add ESLint checks (Workflow)
[!] Add Firefox compatibility checks (Workflow)
[!] Add new screenshots for Spicetown (Figma)˚ZI finally got the thing to work! My project was also delayed, because Hackclub AI wasn't working, but now it's back up and running! I have got multiple styles and you can now also download the image by clicking on download, after generating the image! Now I need to get "Attach reference" to work and actually send the image with the user prompt.UImproved goals UI, looked too messy, so this better layout + priority goals + profit?#Separated the CSS and JS from HTML.˚¥implemented basic crud functions, i added update functions and vault functions to the vault. and then simply wired them to the get screen, i did avoid making another screen, since i wanted to keep the app minimal, but, without another screen, the app was just becoming more congested and complicated. so i made a seperate update screen, for the user to change the password of a specific service. the delete function works the same way, with it getting the master password, and verifying and deleting the password, i did have to use a bit of chatgpt, since i was getting issues with how to get the current pwd field showing and then toggling and all that, but i just made it reveal at the end.MNow my api collects data from HSL about max speeds and traffic light request.MNow my api collects data from HSL about max speeds and traffic light request.Added IR sensor support.Œadded a new type of enemy and a brand new feature: adjustable game difficulty.
you just have to click with your mouse and the number of enemy will increase
(totally not a bug I don't know how to fix lol )Pupdated ereaser logic, added ctrl z and y, and implemented theme aware pen colorõmainly added achievement auto-claim, the extension auto claims achievements for you, removing the hassle. also started work on a better goals UI, too messy˚üI've finished the board. Also thought about making the PCB, and I decided to etch it in school.
That's why there are THT components. Also one clever thing I'm quite proud of is the USB-C connector. As we would only do the back side, and we don't need to care about the front.

I didn't know how far apart the headers should be. So I thought about making it like an ESP dev board, but that would force the board to be a lot longer than needed. So I took the components and roughly layout them out to their corresponding positions, like top or bottom. and that way I knew that almost all components would be at the top aside of the USB-C connector. The USB-C was positioned on top of the module. After routing, I've noticed that it's interfering with the module.
After that, I made pretty labels and that's it. At least for the PCB.
When I'll return from winter break I'll manufacture the PCB. I'm also going to log that. :)˚†I finished up a prototype of the Android app, I still haven't made it to the Figma design yet but this is just for functionality. I still havent gotten to making the overlay yet but im working on that right now. Im first testing the API calls and seeing if the app can see the user's location. It's looking good but then I have to get to the hard bit of developing the iOS version since I have no experience with it.2Working on sending files and text at the same timeBasic setup˚nI am working on Asrani Expenses, a comprehensive expense tracking app with several features. The user can scan their receipts, and expenses are automatically added. AI + On device OCR is used to achieve this. The user can assign complex categorial budgets and also see their analytical statistics in the form of charts/PDF/CSV reports. All in an aesthetic interface.øI added more detail into cpu.py, test_cpu.py and modified registers.py. I ran into a bug which kept returning an assertion error so after a LOT of debugging I have gotten a successful output.#Created base interface with nav bar7I added a functioning sketch app and a little secret...oI implemented Grid to this isntead of using Flex and also the editor is now collapsed when you aren't using it.I mostly thought through the idea and wrote down specifically what features I wanted before planning the tech stack I'll be using. This is, once again, after a couple of nights just lying in bed thinking about it. Planned in Obsidian ofc :)˚NFirst work session!
Started off simple with a title screen (its amazing what you can do with big letters and a nice font).
I also started work on the user image upload. Got a nice UI going with that creamy beige colour. I have a simple flow animation going on, but definitely needs to be iterated over in future sessions. That's it.˚Implemented 2-dimensional (Fractal) Perlin Noise function.

I plan to use some noise function to generate terrain, and the first one that comes to mind is Perlin Noise. I specifically chose to use the improved 2002 version for the performance gains. and (apparently) better artifacting characteristics.

Online articles can be slightly confusing since a number of them seem to confuse Perlin Noise with value noise... Nevertheless, the original paper by Ken Perlin is reasonably well-written, if somewhat dense.

I think I might end up changing to a different noise algorithm. I somewhat dislike the fact that the noise "peaks" tend to form straight lines in N, E, S, W, NE, NW, SE, SW directions due to the nature of the algorithm. Simplex noise seems like a promising alternative.qI added a fully functioning clock application with customizable timers and stopwatches. I'm so proud of this one.5Just added a basic screenshot & my hackatime project.VCreated a menu to select the game to play, and support loading files from the SD card.˚Added a new sweep event! It's a modifiable preset for laser movement that sweeps it across the screen. Currently, it works for vertical lasers sweeping horizontally. I'm trying to get it to work with other rotations too (vertically and diagonally) but that doesn't work right now.tGenerated app binaries and a functioning apk file with Expo EAS and bugfixing in preparation for official production˚ﬂI made the input method better. Basically, now it will calculate the encrypted method every key press, but then we can't necessarily keep up, lets say user copy pasted a message or maybe is just typing fast(bc we use animation) we won't encrypt everything. So my first idea was to encrypt everything in the input box every time we press new key, but that doesn't work becaus then it say the user puts in the alphabet, we will consider the message aababcabcd which is wrong. So then i thot, lets keep a track of what is the longest message that we know they have entered and only calculating the new part. Once enter is pressed, clear out plaintext. However, that doesn't work because there are conflicting accounts of "latest calculated string" so it fails on fast type. I think the problem there was something to do with requests being handled on sepereate threads. What i finally did, is for once in my life found a practical implementation of datastructures. I implemented a queue directly into the plaintext and a flag to see is stuff being handled rn. If yes, you don't do anything because your character wiill eventually get processed as part of the queue. If no, then start the queue, and if new characters are typed they will be added too.∆Just started! Created the base UI 'n stuff, made it fetch all the available routes and stops from Trimet's api, so the user can select which route and bus/train stop along that route that they want.1Currently, I'm working on integration of LiftKit.Qhooray hooray, i added reverse, repeatcount, and delay to tweeninfo!! pretty cool˚¡I have successfully resolved the recent application startup issues. The launch sequence is now stable, and the Engine API is functioning correctly.

Web App Integration I have officially implemented support for Web Apps, allowing users to set interactive web-based applications as their desktop background.

New Wallpapers. To utilize this new feature, I have added two new interactive wallpapers:
- Crossy Road Game: A fully playable version of the game (sourced from crossy.dkydivyansh.com). It includes a functional global leaderboard that syncs in real time (requires an active internet connection).
- Terminal: An interactive 3D wallpaper featuring dynamic ASCII art and a built-in time widget.∆uhh i made ranges for string slices, and empty collections dont brick everything now. most of the language is done, i just need type casting, user input, and a way to actually run the generated code˚ç# Devlog 7: Rockets and GUIs
I made some progress on making rockets actually functional. Upon entering a rocket, you will now be presented with a destination selector screen. Next, I will probably actually make it so you can go to other planets. Mercury, Venus, and Mars currently do not have their dimensions implemented.

Also, I'm testing to see if Markdown works in these devlog text boxes.0optimised site so it takes less fluid active cpu0optimised site so it takes less fluid active cpu0optimised site so it takes less fluid active cpu˚Implemented the national anthems quiz. This should have been easy except apparently Discord doesn't support audio files inside Components V2. Because of that I had to create video files for all of the audio files I was going to use using ffmpeg, which took me a while to work out how to do and how to get down the file size. I think the final result turned out well though. Once I had the videos created it was pretty easy to use the modular quiz code I had made earlier to add them into the bot.Did a bit of UI˚added the tweening system from the original yan again!!
the code is much much cleaner than last time, also :pause() and :cancel() should actually work this time
im also planning to add the other features from roblox's TweenInfo, like delay, reverse, and repeat next=UI + fixing annoying username bug + editing backend login API˚—I made a Meyers diff implementation! 

Special thanks to James Coglan for this set of 3 articles which makes the algorithm make sense (or, more sense than I got from reading the original paper) and also providing a Ruby implementation that I adapted to TypeScript:

I wish I could get hackatime time for the hour spent reading math papers to figure out how the hell all these algorithms work. oh well

Next: probably a basic 3-way merge, then a MVP

(Also, Rhythm Doctor OST is carrying me through this)|Get subviewport working and rewrite all scene changing code to replace subviewport scene instead of actually changing scene.˚I started work on the actual parsing. I had already done some of the groundwork library/API stuff, but I needed to expand on it. I made some classes and typedefs so that the data could be nicely encapsulated. I made the design choice that every variable would fundamentally be a std::vector (which is a dynamic array, nothing to do with a vector in math for you non cpp-people) because I otherwise couldn't do it well or safely with a union. As seen in this screenshot, I have succesfully parsed a single variable's type and name. Yay!¥Don't judge me! I've cleared out all the junk comments and set up a basic 'Hello World.' I'm still getting the hang of TypeScript, so I'll start the actual implementation tomorrow.meow¬Made lampboard! it looks kinda bad rn but i am hopping to ad an animation and maybe make the padding round somehow. However, i need to first focus on plugboard, keyboard, maybe rotors animation.¨Fully created the QR system.

I added a proper accent-color to all inputs. Fixed the colors on modals (transparent bgs!). Added footer reference to me (i ned creds). I fixed scrollbars and the spacing on project card stats.˚DSet up extension, popup, and content script shortcut stuff. when you click on the emoji it appears in whatever textarea youre writing in. However, the searchbar doesnt work and neither does the personal top emojis part work, and there is no other UI in the popup other than the shortcut so I'll need to work on that. I want to make it so that the only part that actually shows up after you use the shortcut being the top emojis and you have to expand out to see commonly used and the search bar, also maybe functionality to use the number keys to print out correspoding top emojisFConnected Flavortown to existing GitHub repository + minor UI changes.˚VI was later thinking of building a stealth monitoring device or a uav drone all the designs and parst list are ready .

I can't build it because it was costly and I wasn't able to get the supplies locallywrote the readme!¿I created a simple hompage and projects section. I created both of these using flexbox elements and the project pages each scroll on their own. I also added hover effects on the project pages.˚7I shipped the updated version of the main website today. I also figured out that nuxt content doesn't work if you have `@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm` and `better-sqlite3` installed at the same time. I also worked on fixing bugs on the main app. Here is a picture of the new blog. It is 1000x better than the old one.˚ûAdded a Spotify widget on my homepage with the music that I'm currently listening to and a button to follow my music [Image 1]. Did I mention the cool comic book style tooltip I added to the button? Go check it out! Reformatted the blog posts to accept images and attachments. I also added embedding, different fonts, and color to the blog posts. Did I mention the quotes (The big yellow box)[Image 2]. Of course I added code snippets and one code liners. Then I added embeddings of spotify youtube and whatnot [Image 3]. (Those caused some nasty bugs with my admin editor). Speaking of the admin editor I made it very nice with preview mode and fullscreen writing mode.¥Added wallet export functionality and wallet clear, the app is ready to be pushed as version 1, just need to figure out the auto update functionality for the transactions on screen˚IAdded the string scanner. That should be the entire scanning system complete which means I can now work on the second part is the parser. The parser will take the list of tokens and turn them into a parse tree and then a stack. The idea with that is to turn the semantic tokens into something which can be run by our interpreter.Add the ASCII titleçgot bgfx working after an hour of debugging. macos really hates rendering on background threads. next: rendering structure and draw commands.˚ Improved function parsing, and started work on documentation!

... Hey, I just had a great idea!˚vmore work on the warped clam. made the pearl ambience particle spawn on the corner of the pearl, made both the warped clam particles animate through their spritesets. i also put in a new model i was given. there were some problems with what's called "z-fighting" (where the textures are overlapping and are "fighting" over the same position) so i had to change a few things.8<div class="welcome-overlay">denial of service lol</div>the great meme reset˚rI got scanning working for identifiers and keywords. Identifiers include things like variable names, function names and keywords are really just anything in the language that has some semantic meaning such as RETURN to return from a function. After this, I'm going to add string scanning and that should be the finished scanner. I'll begin work on the parser after that.˚˙Yay a use for my project

So I spent a long time automating a browser (using "Astral" with Deno) to sign into a Hack Club account and Slack with only the email (pointing to the SMTP server I coded) and it will retrieve the OTP from the email (and delete it) to sign in. This means I can sign in to alt accounts completely programmatically, and soon make new accounts too. Plus, it logs a simple javascript script to run in the console of slack.com that will log you in.

Note about the video: I can enable headless mode if I want, this is just for showing how it works internally. Also I censored my tokens at the end so you can't get into my Slack alt!

Now, you can use the signin and signup popup modals on the landing page to create an account and access the app. Made a MongoDB cluster that currently only stores user data but will hopefully store actual subscription and app data. Also added the first 10 services for subscriptions with all their plans and correct pricing. Added some quality of life features like a confirm popup warning, logout button, and an option to clear subscriptions. I refactored and cleaned up some code as well.àAdded grid overlay and bezier editor + command passthrough!

- accessing elements with index (list[4])yay–hosted this on vercel! This is fully working! The UI is not the best, but the algorithms work! All the code for them is in the github. Below, I just show some of the operations; there are 22 operations total.˜added the list property to elements! it arranges children elements in the order you specify, aligned horizontally and vertically however you specify, and you can add padding in between the elements! it also updates dynamically, and is very cool :DSurpise me!Add the target saving function˚Our first devlog! Up until this point, I've mostly worked on the inner workings of the interpreter, because, as this project is aiming to be a better verion of the Atto-24, having a strong core to stack more functionality on is pretty important. At this point, we have all arithmetic, stack, memory, function call, and IO instructions implemented. Since Micro is designed to allow for multiple games on one "cartridge", I've been working on a executable format which allows us to load in games and libraries at runtime, at specific memory locations chosen at build time. The actual executable format and processing code is done, I just need to finish writing the loader. That's gonna be done by the next devlog probably, and from there, we will tackle graphics and the other external devices needed to make this system work. The photos attached show the general architecture, and a sample executable I've been using for testing. I have been working on this project for a little bit before flavortown started, which accounts for the codebase size.Added servo support.WGot Godot XR working and planned what the environment the player is in should look like6Deployed functions and changed app name to LearnUnlockDeployed app!˚I spent the last however many hours adding workspaces for storing all the bases and stuff (its 1am I cant explain anymore).

When you enter rotor 1, you don't enter wire 'A', you enter wire 'A'+position. Lets say the output of wire 'A'+position is 'B'. You can't input 'B' into rotor 2, you have to input 'B'-position because you need to shift back so that you can factor in the position of rotor 2.

A discord bot that will periodically fetch the French grade platform Pronote (which many schools use, including mine) and will calculate your global average (which is not visible... on pronote) and notify you in your Discord DMs as soon as it happens.

You also have some utilities to calculate what happens with your average and stuff...

Right now I've made a Frame_process in my platform script which manages the level, and already migrated dash, stun and a mutator, and started migrating the attacks.

All this means is that the site will be lightning-fast and will load super quickly.FFixed movement and character positioning. Figured out what to do next.˚¬Ok, so in those 2h, I have just made the api work with the frontend. I implemented WebSocket support, and that's kinda it. I know, I know, even I think it's too little for 2h of work, but you have to believe me, I am glad it didn't take me 3h. Even though I wrote a little bit of code, the amount of debugging I had to do is ISNSANE. That doesn't mean I don't love programming anymore, it's my favorite hobby, I was just telling you how things went. Also, you do want to read the devlog from the frontend, I have basically worked on both at the same time. But for now, it's good night for me‚ù§Ô∏è
P.S: I uploaded the same video as for the fronted because that's where you can see the api's functionality.I added cool stuffúmade a quick browser demo for testing purposes (and finished up getting back to before I deleted everything)

next is probably getting text merges to work˚Ok, it's been more then 1h and 30m, it's been actually like 3h but who counts? (me) So anyway, now the webpage actually uses this WebSocket thing. I searched and documented about it and let me tell you what it does. It is a protocol (fancy term, i know, it means a way of transferring data from one server to another) which allows you to send data at the same time to one another with no time limit. It's the same thing you use to chat on WhatsApp or to call someone. The thing is, it's complicated to set up (it's also my first time, but still, it was hard!), but I got it working. The client and the server will establish a WebSocket connection, providing at the handshake moment (the moment when they connect) the server id of which you wish to have access it's console. For now, I didn't connect the console, but that's going to be easy-peasy compared to this WebSocket thing. 
Also, I made a UI look kinda better, I still didn't add those features I mentioned in the last devlog,. My next goal is to go to sleep I think, and I'll see y'all tomorrow!≤Overall I think all the functions are done. I now added some input validation functions that raise errors when the user inputs something unexpected, to help with error handeling.?I'm making a project on a giving an ai the ability to taste lol˚- Refactored basically all of the existing logic to use classes for each hardware type, and a master Hardware class that keeps track of all of the hardware on the sprig, instead of calling everything from main.cpp.
- The program is now using a screen buffer instead of writing directly to the screen. This allows us to have elements at different z-indexes and to have transparency between the elements.
- Added "fade_to" and "blink" methods to the LED class to handle smooth animations of the pwm enabled LEDs.
- Added the ability to render text to the screen buffer in a 4x6 font, which is stored in a font.cpp file as a hex representation of each character. This could be optimized, since I am using a uint8_t for each row of each character, when I only need half of that memory space.˚"if you set a property's value to a function, it will be automatically updated in love.update, kinda like fusion's scope:Computed!

This is a classic scenario to explore the real-world nuances of money behind a setting up a business. It will have stats and gameplay similar to running an actual bakery. Players learn critical business concepts such as COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) - Track exact production costs using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) inventory; Just-In-Time (JIT) Ordering (juggle freshness with running out of incredients), etc... 

This game uses Phaser.js for main game engine, and other js libraries. Right now, there is a very short moving text tutorial and some SVG image assets.

I also added a Fav icon it is a multi color 2026 in pixel art (I uploaded a image bellow) and I created a ReadMe for some information on Github. I removed the box around the numbers because I think it looks better like this. And lastly I added a button to my main site to go to the countdown ( https://loek.oerlemans.tv/projects/index.html )

# Overall Direction
Backend design: most of the backend MVP proof-of-concept is done, but there are still many small issues to fix.
Frontend foundation: it‚Äôs extremely ugly right now, and I‚Äôll need to spend a lot of time designing it.

# Backend
1. Multi-region support is basically handled, but there are still some bugs to fix.
2. It supports basic HTTP monitoring, but more monitor types still need to be added.
3. It supports basic Discord notifications, but more notification types still need to be added.
4. The team feature is basically not finished.

# Frontend
The basics are done, but it‚Äôs very rough and hasn‚Äôt been designed yet‚Äîstill needs a lot of time for design work.
Since the backend still needs changes, the frontend will also need further redesign to stay aligned with the backend.√I added the basic structure of the level overview, in which we wanted to have a level or better said "day" for each day before Christmas, with increasing dificulty and challanges coming with themFinally finished the Back-EndtWorked on creating an enemy and making it move to a target position.

Thank you DevCmb for the InvControl library.
Hm I wonder why I made that ü§î˚First devlog!!! Ok, so, I made a very simple webpage with reactjs, and used a library which seems pretty well known to fetch APIs. I used it to get a list of minecraft servers installed on the actual server. It isn't anything big, but it can fetch data and im happy about it. I made a button so you can even refresh it yourself. I think im going to work a little tiny bit on the UI, then add some features like accessing the minecraft server console from the browser (I'm scared of that because I think I have to use WebSocket, even though I have no ideea how to use it or what it isü•≤). But for now, I'm excited!
P.S: Im logging almost 2h of work so my bad for that, and also, in the video, you will see that I tried refreshing the server list. I assure you it worked, but it was just the same:)Added basic Three Scene anim:Update-1: python side code works, onto the optimizing part˚	Day 1 ‚Äî Closing the Loop with Kalman + PID

Today I successfully closed the control loop of my Inertial Control Sandbox. I implemented a 1D Kalman filter to estimate angular velocity and gyro bias, and used this estimate as the input for a PID controller.

The system converged stably to a target angular velocity despite sensor noise. While the estimated bias did not converge to the true bias value, the controller still performed well, revealing an important observability limitation when no rest condition or secondary sensor is available.

This confirmed that rate control can tolerate imperfect bias estimation, but angle estimation will not ‚Äî motivating the next phase of the project.

I actually just installed Arch (btw!) onto my laptop 2 days ago, and thus does not have any development tools. I've installed:
* Bun, as my package manager
* VSCode, as my code editor
and followed the Flavortown guide to set up Hackatime. I've initialized a new project without any frameworks with Vite. (I just don't think frameworks are needed for apps so simple). This project should be really simple and shouldn't take too long!

I underestimated how different those two filesystems were which caused a lot of issues. Today (23rd) I discovered that the Inode struct I was using was wrong for EXT4, so I found this nice [Gitlab Page](https://gitlab.incoresemi.com/software/linux/-/blob/0e698dfa282211e414076f9dc7e83c1c288314fd/Documentation/filesystems/ext4/inodes.rst#i-osd2) which explained how EXT4 works and the structs that were involved. Unfortunatly it didn't tell me how to checksum things which was a big issue because `fsck` was complaining about checksums, so I had to look at the Linux Kernel Source. I still havent gotten to checksuming the Group Descriptors. I was able to checksum the superblock though. With the help of `debugfs` using this command `sudo debugfs /dev/nbd0p2` I was able to identify issues with the Inode Table.˚êI've started working on this project the day prior to Flavortown. üòÖ
I've looked at the meshtastic RAK4631 definition, as I won't need to make my own board definition.
I have in mind that most likely I'll be CNC milling the PCB. That's why I also added a USB2.0 header to be able to hack in a USB cable.
Ehm... many blank stares into the RAK datasheet...
I came up with a minimal schematic seen in the second screenshot.
Then I looked into the pin definition and named the pins with their functions, which was a mistake, as I wouldn't really know which pin is which and I would need to reference the pin definition which is quite cumbersome.
So I went with "{PX.Y}/{Relevant Fn}"
Added pin headers, as Dev boards would be useless without it. ;)
And today I added the menu button and LED. Noted: the nrf52 chip can't provide enough power to drive the LED by itself.

To build a solid foundation and give my friend ‚Äî who is working with me as the designer ‚Äî something to work with, I started by creating the entire base structure for the main menu and all the sub‚Äëmenus you can access from it.

I also made sure that everything can be freely resized without the buttons shifting into the wrong positions once the background image is added later on. To achieve this, I set up the buttons so their width automatically scales up or down depending on the current window size of the application.îI have been working on it for 7 hours and it is like a trial and error since last 3 hours.

Learned something new with easy vercel redis integration through vercel kv. Started writing the test first post ever after creating the ui. Is it nice? Right now md supports bold and italic but im planning on making it feel more like google docs. Also I did not write all of this code in 22 minutes I have to share some of the credit with myself from last thanksgiving and also Claude 0pus 4.5 (my glorious king)çI have been working on simulating some topics from Physics, Chemistry and Biology. So far, I have been failing in finding the correct assets.˚4This devlog actually encompasses over 40 hours of work but I am not sure why it isn't tracked... hm. Anyways, here's a rundown:
I began work on a custom frontend for the hackclub ai service after I found out that @mahad had redone most of it to make it viable as a service that people can use.

Step one was figuring out what I even had to do! I've had experience with building chat interfaces in the past, and I settled on my personal favorite combo -- the Vercel AI SDK + Next.JS. Recently, the AI SDK, in collaboration with shadcn/ui, added a new "AI Elements" component library for building chat interfaces. Perfect, this saved me much work!

Next, I had to design the backend. I rarely do DB stuff, so this was all a bit new to me, but, I decided on using Drizzle ORM + Hackclub Nest's PostgreSQL instance. I used `better-auth` and Hackclub's own OAuth solution to get a user ID I could store in the database. The database also stores your API keys so you can access it anywhere all the time. The DB stores chats too (what a suprise!).

Anyways, that's about it for the technical side (or what I could recall). The actual application has many features not too dissimilar from a client like ChatGPT or OpenWebUI. It has a sidebar for chats and it uses a model to generate a name for your chats (plus a fun little emoji) on the fly. UI uses shadcn all across the board. Auth and API keys are handled in the bottom left corner. The mobile UI is quite nice IMO. Image gen works pretty well.

NOTE: Currently nonfunctional since hackai is down due to a temporary lack in funding.\I am making an extension which detects distracting website and provides motivational quotes.˚[im just at the grindy part where i get to implement all the features. its still so much faster than my last attempt thanks to treesitter being awesome. my previous method was like [source code -> lexing -> building ast -> interpreter] but now its like [source code -> treesitter -> treeslator -> transpiler] and its so much easier. anyways structs˚ÿI updated a bunch of things to prepare to ship! I deployed the site to a DigitalOcean VPS, added Docker build support, added CI workflows, and fixed bugs. I also drew an 88x31 button (not tracked on my time). I was originally planning on deploying this to Heroku, so I had some hours working on setting that up (~1 hour) that I had to revert due to an issue.
I had to make some pages "dynamic" for them to work in the production environment. I found a few other bugs as well, like RSS feed links not properly leading to my website. I also made all of the widgets fully operational (including the fancy clock on the front page). Overall, this was very technically complicated to figure out, but I got the site fully operational.eI'm working on my fidrst project! This is so exciting. I can't wait to share more updates as I build.KRevised settings page, added icons and hack club ai as a option of provider(i am working on a Elderly caring website–Figured out about '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage' for my data storage which will be on the user's phone itself.

The body is composed of three rigidbodies, a head, a body and legs, which are connected by joints. The IK for the legs is purely visual and the collider for them is a circle. I used lerping to get the legs to move smoother and the legs shoot a raycast whenever they get too far from the body and the legs land at the hit result. There are four leg sprites whose transforms are adjusted every frame to match the segments of the legs.zI added my recent projects as well as the gravity interactions, and all my old media, I still need to add a couple things.˚¯I got the oxygen system working. On planets/moons with no oxygen, you will need to wear a space helmet to survive. You also need to have oxygen canisters in your inventory. When you have a space helmet equipped and are in a place with no oxygen, a bar will appear at the top of your screen to show you how much oxygen you have left. If you don't have a helmet (or are out of oxygen), you take damage, lose a ton of hunger, and gain Nausea V. Next, I'm going to add a machine to fill the oxygen canisters.LLast-minute touchups and bug fixes before shipping! I also added a 404 page.vI'm working on a very cool project about stuffed animals cuz I like them, maybe like a website or sum I'm not sure yet˚ÜIts actually 1 hour and 30 mins of work because I never installed the wakatime extension but I had a basic console app first then added a UI using react and typescript, I'm still quite new to react and know enough Typescript but I'm always learning. It uses my engine (it's just addition and subtraction) to figure out based on your ETA in seconds, what song in your music queue you will be at and at what timestamp when you arrive at your destination. I'm going to include Spotify's API, Apple MusicKit and I'm still working on figuring out how I can check your Google Maps route without the user having to type their ETA in manually to the app.˚ÚDealing with scope errors right now and it's hella annoying cause according to w3schools, if i declare it as var, it will automatically be accessible inside the function which doesn't seem to be teh case.

i added the ability to create children in the :new function by just adding elements to the children field!
also had to make some changes to the screen class, so that elements that have larger ancestry (being a child of a child of a child... etc) render in front more. i think thats just a new feature in general i think zindex used to be global (which should probably be a setting on screens... :P)

also because the devlog was 13 minutes before uhh so i made the Color type a bit better. added a fromRgb function that creates a color with values from 0-255 instead of 0-1, and made the alpha property optional, being fully visible by defaultÓSo this is a continuation of the project

I collapsed the entire thing into one ruleset that affects the entire domain (since the page system didn't even mean anything as all of the css is bundled in one file anyways). New color system and I darkened the green color by 10% so ye peepers don't stop functioning. I fixed many issues with the sidebar and addressed the user profile under the sidebar. I also added some tweaks to the sizing of images in devlogs so they shrink to fit instead of being clamped to an aspect ratio.œI wrote lots of documentation!

Instead of just pinging URLs, my script opens a stream connection and inspects the initial byte chunks for valid #EXTM3U HLS headers. This filters out dead links, fake 200 OK responses, and duplicates.

Create, update, delete, and list.˚¶i got a bit carried away haha, and completely forgot to write any devlogs, Since my last devlog, I've done a lot of refactoring. The code feels so much cleaner now, instead of just every feature thrown together, i have no clue how i managed to keep my sanity before haha. I've moved some stuff to functions in external files, and moved all error handling over to the main file using some custom error classes for the different rcodes. Not all of them are used, I just added them in case I decided to use them later. I've also made a sqlite db, with a basic seed, to query DNS records from, instead of just hardcoding an IP. Speaking of DNS records, it now supports multiple DNS record types. The next steps for the DNS server is to implement winston. Apart from that, I think that's everything I need to do for the DNS. After I'd probably make a small web dashboard to get your own records on the server, and maybe even reciprocate for unknown domains, however I'm not sure how that will work regarding security. I don't want to be vulnerable to amplification attacks. Anyway, unfortunately there isn't a lot to show you, however below is a video of the server in use, visiting example.com.®Right now, I'm working on getting a live stream set up, and it's basically been done.

I hate javascript. It's so tedious. One of the problems I ran into was that in order to delete an item from a list, you have to set that list to a filter of itself. I guess I'm so too used to python's readability. I accidentally typed print instead of console.log lol.˚8so believe it or not ive been working on splatter for ~6 hours total and it looks kinda bad
BUT i am done with it i believe
i added a circle around the mouse and i made the splatter react to the angle of the circle depending on where it hits it
the problem was when i made the splatter function and ran it for the first time, it tanked the fps to ~30 (it was at 2,000 before... although tbf i have integrated [radeon 890M])
but i went through the whole thing, removed every floating point operation i could and kept it all in ints, and eventually decided that running the whole function 20 times for each pixel isnt the greatest idea
that being said! it doesnt look thaaaaat bad, but it certainly doesnt look like it took 6 hours

Just exploring!˚7Hey everyone! Just a quick update on some recent fixes. I spent some time ironing out a couple of annoying issues with the 3D engine this days.
First up, I finally tracked down a nasty Win32 API bug that was making 3D wallpapers unstable on Windows. That's officially fixed now, and the engine is working properly.
I also cleaned up some rendering glitches that were happening specifically with Three.js scenes. Your 3D backgrounds should look much sharper now without those errors.
Things are running way smoother now.
 Let me know if you run into anything else!˚BSadly, I'm going to have to write a lot of Regexes for this project, good practice tho. I made a detector for the Neoforge mod loader, that as I type this I realize is not guaranteed and will need to be changed. I also made a checker for the inputted file extensions, so you can't enter anything other than a .txt or .log.˚öI've expanded the Art III Drawing page by adding an overlay header section and a full gallery layout to better showcase my artwork. I also uploaded new drawing pieces, like a sunflower, a De'VIA-inspired owl sign, and a charcoal portrait. I also implemented a responsive grid-based gallery and added hover animations to the artwork images for more interactivity and visual beauty. And I refined the navbar hover effects by adding subtle scaling and text shadows to create a more polished interface overall. I really wanna fix the image layout so it looks like professional art portfolios so that's what I'm likely going to work on next. And also adding more drawing!EI'm warming up doing, some challenges before diving in to the project˚bAdded a couple of stylistic stuff (visible markdown syntax on some headers - using a different font because the # sign on IBM Plex Mono is lowk kinda horrendous for this purpose), fixed a few visual bugs in blog pages, and added a new page for project items without links.

I updated the style.css file to improve layout and color scheme, and responsive design. Also added script.js for future interactivity. New CSS enhancements include hover effects on navbar links that slightly scale up on hover, as well as interactive art image that scales up and lifts with a subtle shadow when hovered over.

1. the original frg source
2. transpiled rust code
3. RAW transpiled rust code˚ûthe start of this god-foresaken UI library. this is the first time I've written code in a few months, and I don't have much experience writing a library, so bare with me!

I decided on an immediate mode UI design inspired by the likes of egui. however, it is wasteful to have to create resources every frame for. as such, I decided to implement memoization. I'm not sure if this is the best way, but:

for every `pub trait UiObj: Any`
there is a `pub trait UiObjMemoize: dyn_hash::DynHash {}`.

this latter memoize trait is constructed only from the immediate mode method, and does not hold any other state required for blitting the object.

for instance, a `if container.button("hello, world!") { /* ... */ }` will create an instance of the struct
```rs
#[derive(Hash)]
pub(crate) struct ButtonMemoizeState<'a>(&'a str, &'a ButtonStyle);
```
as `ButtonMemoizeState("hello, world!", &ButtonStyle::default())`.

this is then looked up in a hashmap of the `Container` of the field
`pub children: HashMap<u64, Box<dyn UiObj>>`.
note that I am using a u64 here rather than a `dyn UiObjMemoize` -- this is to workaround a limitation where you cannot use a dyn trait object as a hashmap key. instead, I use a stable hasher from the fx_hasher crate where I hash it to a u64, acheiving the same result but slightly more long-winded. (`fn hash_memoized_obj<T: UiObjMemoize>(v: &T) -> u64;`)

technicality aside, the API now looks like:
```rs
fn render(ui: &mut fruit::Ui) {
    // todo: enter container with closure
    if ui.top_root.button("HAIII") {
        println!(">w<");
    };
}
```

no tangible example yet, just base code.

todo: garbage collection / reference counting for memoization, closures and ctru context (HID, GFX, APT, citro2d::Instance, app state), layouts, rendering backend.
blockers: rendering backend (notably C2D_Text).

Started off with my catppuccin css variable base then I went through the source code of flavortown, first changing all hardcoded colors to similar variables as a layer in my userstyle. Then, I patched the entire site with those colors making sure it looked nice in every case. Finally, I published it to userstyles.world. This served as an initial step that allows me to improve over time.˚ØI created a simple navbar design using the w3schools tutorial and adding my own effects in HTML. I used hover properties and transitions to animate the links when hovered. Currently, I only have one page but plan to add more. The current page is just a placeholder to make sure the navbar remains at the top when scrolled (caused by using fixed positioning in CSS). Next, I will create some more pages and try to center the navbar.˚ÌI started this project before finding Flavortown, so I was already partway through when I began posting devlogs. The project is a LEGO inline-3 vacuum engine with a custom multi-speed gearbox.
So far, I‚Äôve been working mainly on the gearbox. I designed a servo-driven shift gate and shifter, assembled the 3D printed gearbox parts to check fit, and revised parts like the reverse gear and shaft spacers to fix alignment issues. Most of the work has been iterating between CAD and test fits, adjusting designs as problems come up.
The goal is to have the gearbox shift automatically using servos based on engine RPM. Next, I‚Äôll keep refining the mechanical parts and start integrating everything more closely with the engine and control system.setup hacktime and edited css˚J- Made the daily question items update according to what happens to them accordingly (Opened, comlpleted, etc)

Architecture uses SwiftUI on both the iOS app and companion watchOS app. iOS app allows you to store schedules and classes (functionality like to-dos, calendar will occur later). It then stores in SwiftData and syncs to the watch with Watch Connectivity, where the watch will also save it in it's copy of the SwiftData db and set up the complications as necessary (the main watchOS component right now).˚PToday I've managed to finish the schematic along with footprints.

I started researching button matrices three months ago for my project called Travell Buddy.

New milestones reached: 17,000 lines of code (!) and 23 integration tests passing (and also, wow look at all those unit tests!) (see images)I completed the project˚So i went a little schizo over UVR

- Instead of recalculating all the time, the app only recalculates the position after each movement you do (For ex, moving, zooming in, etc.)
- Changed all of the floats to doubles and then to long doubles to maximize size, I was hitting precision errors all the time
- Began to implement a heat map thing but I don't want to create that right now
- Local coordinates rather than global coordinates for drawing out the pointsWI'm excited for Flavortown!

Previously, the plan was just parsing tokens and evaluating them, but:
1. It would make the eventual implementation of functions much more annoying
2. Re-interpreting the tokens would be much slower than running opcodes
3. ...I kinda just wanted to do opcodesÂKinda curious how this project will go on!! I've gathered some ideas for some simple "party" games in my head over the circlus of the last couple months.

I've done some preliminary brainstorming this past week though and hope to come up with an idea soonI finished making nothing'Just getting started and gathering data˚ÄIt has been some time. The running server part was very easy, but I wanted to make the server run in a subprocess and then be able to tap into the subprocess of any server whenever you would like. Finaly, after 30min or more, I gave up and let the features I already implemented stay. The features I implemented now are:
1. Automatic acceptance of EULA (user must confirm tho)
2. Automatic launch script creation (works on any os; windows, linux, macOS,... tested only on windows tho:( )
3. Added a config file where the user can modify the startup script if they know what they are doing.

I will not give up, i will try again to see if i can manage to make the buttons become next to the to-do list.$I'm working on YOLO for this project˚¥I've decided to create a website to store my artworks throughout the years. It took some time to plan out how each page will look like, but now I've begun to put everything into code. So far I've built a basic HTML/CSS layout with a full-width floating panel that has top and bottom margins, split into two columns: the left side has a centered title and placeholder artist statement (with a color pallate that I probably spent too long experimenting with), and the right side has a dashed image placeholder. Also I‚Äôve added a subtle box shadow to give the panel a floating effect. My next step's gonna be either making the layout responsive or adding actual artwork, I haven't decided yet.1Added viewing wins & losses and claiming winningsÁI‚Äôm currently implementing the final parts of an existing project.

This devlog shows one such feature that I eventually got working.

- Be me
- Want to organize the ever-growing playlist into sub-playlists
- Try to do so without repeating entries or rewriting the original JSON
- Pull my hair out trying to figure out how to traverse the arrays without the original indexes
- Realize I'm unnecessarily reinventing the wheel here
- Rewrite based on how the Gallery is organized, rewriting the JSON in the process
- Now you can select a subcategory of the Vocaloid songs I listen to! :D˚ˇ Made a lot of stuff!

I never programmed an add-on before, so it takes a lot of thinking and trail and error.
Until this devlog I only search for best GUI library to use. I think I finally found one - GuiEngine.
From now I will use it.?Made the suggested passwords section and filled the about page.àMade the goals system better, and also now pasting is already in the platform so removed that code, made a readme, cleaned up some code,UPinning the sidebar!!!!!!!!!!!!! a requested feature by Ganesh on #flavortown-help :3˚ïI set up some basic utility to build and run app with a .sh script. Also created a frame class, which is, a frame? Basically can render any title and size, think  it's awesome. Maybe gotta change the borders to something more visually appealing in the future, like circles? Anyways, I think next I will actually start grabbing some temperature info from /sys/class/hwmon/ and showing it into the interface‡After a lot of debugging and confusing nix stuff, I now have apollo working on nixos!

I'll figure out how to get a virtual display working eventually...IAdded a reactive price history chart to the prediction market stock view.DFINALLY finished a working breathing system with fails and accuracy!;Spicetown website!!!!!!!!!!! shall be improved soon (maybe)ÇI've added support for the "Preserve Specular Light" option, and the specular light now lights all faces of the object by default.˚ªI could honestly continue with this stretch, but I'm worried of losing progress, so better safe than sorry. I implemented the basic menus of the game using a template by Maaack, added basic card dragging and drawing, and made some artwork so that while the game is a prototype, it looks like a good one. Also experienced a lot of very annoying bugs.

All change logs up to this point:
- Added new fonts
- Added basic drawing from deck functionality
- Added some cards
- Added card dragging
- Added ALL 52 cards and their data
- Annoying bug caused seemingly by instantiating cards on a texturerect. Now no cards will instantiate AT ALL, though it says so in the console. I fixed it once by upgrading the project, to my great relief, but I accidentally reproduced it while adding texturerect and seemingly nothing can fix it now. How the heck am I supposed to explain that?
- Began writing spaghetti code for determining the hokm (failed)
- Attempted to add card fanning (failed)
- I also implemented using the main menu to play the game
- The card issue seemed to be local to the scene only upon testing in a new scene, but then it reappeared everywhere in any number of new scenes.
- I somehow solved it by just adjusting the position of the Hand node. The cards don't appear exactly where they are, it does so like 30 px beneath
- Maybe I moved the hand node while adding that one texture rect.
- Doesn't explain why upgrading the project fixed it though..
- The sheer simplicity of the hand node may have allowed me to move it several times after getting it to work in other scenes, making the malfunction seem random
- That simple oversight may have been what allowed the issue to remain so persistent.˚zMostly finished up all the simplification rules in Cohen's book. Tons of bug fixes and some more features, such as automatic factorial evaluation (as seen in the screenshot) and a few index laws (not pictured, sadly). I'm just missing fraction evaluation (e.g., a fraction + a normal number) but that can be done relatively quickly. Once that's done, I'll go down the road of code clean-up for a few hours, because it's currently a mess. Most of the simplification logic is inside of one class in a file with a ton of large methods... the file already exceeds 400 lines so once I'm done it'll probably be 6-700 LOC across a few files.˚ Improved the layout of the page, made the navigationbar more responsive and deleted some of the uneccesary code that i had.

I also tried to make a time-logging feature, but it needs a lot of calculation and javascript, which is too advanced rn

I also did work on the projects for coding tab, where i improved the "project overview", which is the list on the left. I feel that i really have improved my knowledge in UI, f.x i have worked in css on margin, gaps the corners, the shdowing, etc. So i have a better understanding about it now.qi worked on the only feature of this... the pomodoro method! doesnt loop but you can just open it up again right?Yworked a lot on the initial capabilities. it has browser features, and also a normal modeUploaded the npm package˚MGot a basic system running with den, nixos, flake-parts and a lot of small modules. I will say, I do _not_ like bash scripting. I got AI to generate an update script for my custom apollo (sunshine/game streaming fork) package which somehow worked first try. The rest of the stuff is mine though. I forgot how cursed it is to use nix.˚cGot the project set up and published on GH.

Also, accidentally made a circular dependency when trying to make a Promise wrapper with a progress callback. That was interesting to solve. (Builder to the rescue?)

(There's not really much to show, because most of this is library stuff - eventually there will be a browser demo, but we're not there yet)- Added explosions˚I implemented the brush tool by sending data to the GPU using Vulkan push constants. I then wrote a simple wave equation solver in the compute shader for testing. The next step will be to actually implement the Schrodinger Equation and flesh out the side panel UI.Øi just did some small changes:
- fixing the color of the spikes so that its the same as the background
- making stuff load asynchronously
- add types for the data
- pearto˚∑ui redesign!!!!! (for like the fourth godamn time)

i literally just moved some stuff around and added an actual layout. i also made all the text smaller, because it fits more stuff. i added a sidebar!!!!! i still need to make the sidebar button to get it out of collapsible mode tho. 

one of the main reasons i wanted to do this redesign along with better ux was to also improve the exporting feature, cuz it was really really buggy, and really terrible before. 
so yeah

oh yeah i also really want to add a cool settings dialog menu thingy where you can change the theme and volume and stuff

heres a lil video of spamton below, along with a screenshot of the ui before the redesign:sweetjI made the 2 way communication work a lot better with you being able to send a message anytime you want toçCreated the design for profile and game page in Figma.

I changed from Courier New to IBM Plex Mono because Courier New was kinda hard to read for long paragraphs. I also experimented with various background shades of beige until they all looked the same.˚3Implement email provider integration with Gmail, IMAP, and Outlook
- Added Gmail provider with function to list emails using Google APIs.
- Implemented IMAP provider to connect and fetch unseen emails.
- Created Outlook provider to retrieve emails via Microsoft Graph API.
- Set up Express server to handle Slack events and OAuth routes for Google and Microsoft.
- Developed Slack app with commands and actions to connect email providers.
- Added modals for email input and IMAP login in Slack.
- Implemented provider detection logic based on email domain.0Added more notification template, to be more funiAdded moon rocks and a moon dimension. Probably next going to work on the method for getting to the moon.¿I made 2 direction communication work properly, but I still have to improve uppon it to make it work with one person typing 2 messages after eachother, not just replying to the others messages:I will be using some foam and 3D printing for this project>I created the communtication between the client and the serverátheme system v2 now supports profile pages!!!! take a look :eyes_wtf:
something non-theme based is getting cooked up... be patient!!!!˚PI've completely reworked the back-end to handle the authentication part. 
Front-end now (I just began working on it...) has a landing-page, dashboard, login an register page. They suck visually but works for now.
The back-end seems to be working and a Token is being given to front-end so it doesn't lose the just-made authentication.4Boring ahh accuracy code, trying to get this to work˚‚- Spent forever getting ESP32 and project setup.
- Learned basics of C++, PlatformIO, and VSCode.
- Setup core timer functionality and logic.
- Created temporary I/O over serial.

Next I want improve the way inputs and outputs are handled to be better prepared for a physical display and buttons. I also want to add a way to store preset tests and recent tests.

I'm having some issues with GitHub ATM but as soon as those are all sorted out I'll add the repo to the project.Kadded competition fucker (tm do not steal)
added more project page supportöSeems, done, this site tracks every sieger and tells you thier coins, how much projects they have and more importantly did they get their laptop or not :)ÃAdded dynamic routing like nextjs for bun prisma api with moreover made a registration api that return the auth token and the refresh key

FUN FACT: Everything it too encrypted I forgot how do I decrypt˚Oi worked on some code organization and housekeeping cuz my code is actually terrifying
to be specific, i made playlist loading and playlist indexing two separate things, and basically improved the file management system.
i also started on the playlist selection screen, and worked on a cool animation thingy for the selection box thing.
next to do: bug fixing (yayyyyyyyyyy)
so yeah, since nothing visual really changed, here's a short clip of the player screen below ig.
(also i tried to change the jumper wires to actual solid-core wires, but then just gave up after like 8 wires lol)˚Finally the beginnings of some sort of simplification! Following Joel S. Cohen's Computer Algebra and Symbolic Computation, Elementary Algorithms rules for a simplified structure of algebraic expressions has been a bit challenging given my current codebase. It also contains some unique rules that I wouldn't have thought of. For example, it doesn't allow negative signs outside of a number's literal value. Something like -x would be reduced (internally) to -1 * x, which is interesting but makes complete sense.˚òThis is a project I'm resuming that's about ~70% done I think. I made a minimalist page and it technically has all the content I need? The dark/light theme took a while to get (still not fully smooth in the contact form iframe) - it's the only feature that needs javascript. 

Remaining goals: make website more accessible, change font/styling of website to be more readable, finish projects and about page˚pI FINALLY GOT SPLATTER WORKING
i know the devlog says one hour but that is FALSE
i spent maybe 3 hours just pacing around my room trying to get this darn splatter to work, but after wild scratches of a madwoman (figures 1 and 2) i finally got this cursed function to work
is it my fault that i didnt comment my code before? maybe. will i comment this code now? nahh
is it my fault for trying to do this all entirely in a shader instead of taking advantage of proceduralism and everything else in a normal language? maybe. will i stop? definitely not
anyways i added the code on picture 3 and the product on 4 ok thx byeåCreated a simple web app using Flask to build off of, as well as created a base template, and a light mode navbar based on the Figma design.…I worked on the Ui for the new home screen.

Got some good bloom/styling down, basic particles, a basic laser, and movement!˚©I floundered around with assembly and hooks before figuring out that I need to use a combination of a GetKeyHook and a system flag for the alpha key modifier to detect F5! And broke the emulator lots doing it (as seen in the pics). 

Some blunders I've had: 
- Trying to use the two other types of hooks (RawKeyHook, GetCSCHook) instead 
- Trying to make a menu hook for F5 (it looks like a menu... and acts like a menu... but isn't classified as a menu for the purposes of hooks.) 
- Mixing up include files and assemblers (eventually settled on ti84pce.inc and SPASM) 
- Trying to make an interactive menu with display text 

Thank you so much to this one french guy from a calculator forum in 2015 who had a working calculator-wide shortcut key that saved me from hook purgatory

I only just checked how much was here, and lo and behold, its all there. These are the devlogs I've written locally, in order.

I've decided to make a DNS server, because what better way to learn how something works than to make it yourself. I'm planning to start with a Codecrafters tutorial, which are great, because they make you figure everything out yourself. I would seriously recommend it. Anyway, I've started on the first stage, where I've set up a basic server. My goals for this are to have a basic authoritative DNS server that has a few records for basic websites, and records for custom (free!) domains for users who use the DNS, with a small web dashboard to manage your records. I'll also make it reciprocal for domains its not responsible for. 
--
I've finished up the sections where I've had to build a header, question, and answer, and right now, it can receive a request, and completely ignore what you send and reply with a probably unrelated record.
--
I've now finished up parsing the request the user has sent, so now it can at least form (probably) RFC compliant responses. It still responds with a hardcoded IP however. I've decided to not do the last stage, as it deviates too far from my goals for the project.

Still havent figured out why the banner/header isnt going to the top shits driving me insaneœI spent a while working out how to implement subcommands in discordjs but I think I have it working now. Once I had it worked out I created two subcommands under quiz for guessing national anthems and flags.˚ÑWow SMTP servers are weird

OK so I made a TCP server with Deno on port 25 (SMTP) that listens for connections then sends a message back basically saying hello to the client, and it logs packets received to the console. This took way too long. Seems like the online checkers do not work correctly or maybe I'm missing a gigantic thing but I found a program to test it so yeah hope that works.

Note about screenshot: This is an external testing program I found on the internet that I'm hoping didn't give me a virus, you can see at the top that it connects and receives "220" and more from my server. This is the part that was so harddddddd˚üAfter an hour I finally aligned most of the components and began wiring the power supply, and I gotta be honest this was the most interesting but frustrating part. Here are some tips I gradually figured out
- Wired the closest pins and components first cuz you can via the long distance parts
- STAY PATIENT, LIKE VERY VERY VERY PATIENT
- Be careful with the 90 degree angle (idk why but I just heard it's bad :(∏Found a new video to put on the background, had to compress it to make it run faster (still a delay between when it starts), also firebase authentication works with signup and login :DAplayer list now shows health and hunger and is an actual list nowMCreated the design for the homepage in Figma. Both light and dark mode added.˚˝I gain my first experience with backend!
Decided today was the day I would finally confront the mysterious beast known as ‚Äúbackend.‚Äù Spoiler: it is terrifying. Spent a solid hour (maybe two) watching an endless loop of Firebase tutorials. Tried to follow along. Failed spectacularly. Watched my API keys sit there, unhidden, mocking me. Made a mental note that hiding them is apparently a myth and I probably should have just accepted my fate. Decided to pivot before my brain melted: authentication. Spent the next chunk of time debugging sign-in, sign-out, and anonymous users. Error messages popped up every chance they got. Did I make progress? Kind of. Did I understand what I did? Also kind of. Am I done hiding my API keys? Absolutely not. /*Scrapbook*/ßAdded a moderation system so bad people wont say harmful things to our dear Symphony!

I also made it so that the side panel doesn't overlap the viewport (the blue-green gradient part in the image below). Hopefully next devlog I'll get the brush tool working.˚BIn the previous 7.5 hours of coding, I've added an alarm daemon, a weather app, and Piston's main speech-to-text engine "VOSK" has been replaced by OpenAI's FasterWhisper. 
You can simply tell the AI to list, add and clear alarms in a natural way, e.g. "Wake me up at 8 in the morning."

You can also ask the AI to tell you the weather like windspeed, temperature, and wind direction in your region.

- Organize ur components based off the blocks in the schematic, like you can select the components all together in the schematic page and they will automatically be selected in the PCB page as well
- Connect the main components first!!! Very important cuz you dont want to fix the capicitors first and realize they are in the way!!!˚ÉI tried to implement the whole thing, but right now, even though it's scrambling into a letter, the decryption is not working. Enigma machine is supposed to be, lets say you used rotors 1 0 and 4, with no leads, then typed "HELLO WORLD" and got "XERCL DSOPL" then somebody else should be able to use rotors 1 0 4 and type "XERCL DSOPL" to get "HELLO WORLD" but right now it's not workingMath˚øAdded guest mode that stores data in local storage so you can actually use the app instead of being stuck on the landing page, logged in state stored in session storage, profile customization for username and password, subscription sorting with different options, subscription editing with a custom modal, license markdown, and code of conduct markdown for GitHub, updated styling and types, and optimized code so it's kind of slightly performant.#I have started by installing VSCodeßFinish the setup, now i am moving on to the actual encryption.

There's about ~30 minutes of time in here that was supposed to be for a different project (My raylib mandelbrot set viewer) but I forgot to open a new workspace in my ide or something so now all of the time is allocated here... whatever... :(ÀWrote some docs on the docker containers provided, added react-email (https://react.email/), and bumped next to version 16.1.0
The scaffold script now supports automatically removing unused dependenciesjmore treeslator stuff:

It's still VERY choppy and unfinished, there's tons of bugs that I have to fix but I'm almost done!˚ºThe VM is better now (still can't see it,) lots of types stuff were worked on (also intangible,) and "let" statements are in (that is, variable declaration! See below for visual proof!) This involved creating a little environment ("Env") system.

An Env is just a Map which maps identifiers to values. The evaluator keeps a stack of these (currently arbitrarily capped to 256 Envs,) that, when we need to set or get a variable, is traversed to find it. The global Env contains stuff like types, global functions, etc., and sits on the bottom of the stack. As, for example, functions get called, Envs get pushed in, acting like local scopes, and popped out when no longer needed... it's pretty nice.nI added a desktop icon! It also has a cool mouseover effect. I'm really liking how this OS is coming together!cat#Created a new logo for the app icon¢It can now generate images..yay!

It stores the data temporarily on memory until the other app does a get request in time. There are still a few visual bugs and I need to write documentation but I think this project is pretty close to being a v1!˚WI made a widget on my homepage for blog posts, made my projects page pull from the database, improved mobile support, and added project management to my admin panel!  The projects page was originally constructed from an array, but uses the database now, so I can add new projects of mine without needing to edit the code. This also included building an admin panel for actually editing the projects. I also moved buttons around on mobile to make it look much better. I tried to change the background to an image, but my CSS didn't end up working as I wanted it to, so I had to discard those changes.˚NDay 2 - Create Blog
I designed The Blog section of my personal website. Flavor town lagged and posted my first pst twice so I actual spent a bit over an hour on the first devlog and Had to work overtime to post today. Currently the Javascript decided it hates me so it wont show the 3 lorem ipsem post. at least I got through CSS ok.˚=I added basic audio functionality (hackatime is being weird and only adding 40 minutes on this devlog, but It's alright though). This audio functionality just includes a basic test right now and I am yet to link it with the rest of my code and add a way to actually record, I'm 99% sure that's a job that takes like ~30 minutes just because of how smoothly everything works and how easy the awesome library that I am using is to use. Check out my recent commit on my GitHub for this project to see which library (its really just one header file in the dependencies folder).Make a little aim trainer game for both testing and fixing some bugs and as an example for anyone who wants to use this library3I just created the main screen and polished it some˚àI worked on websocket loading status. Using react-use-websocket, it tells the user if they are connecting, connected, or disconnected (that short flash of disconnected is only on firefox, ugh, firefox annoys me sometimes).

Originally, i was using the `array.new_fixed` instruction, which requires you to list every member of the list in order to instantiate it. This is nice because it is useable in extended const contexts, so you can get away with immutable lists being actually immutable. However, I then realised that I was initialising lists with a maximum length of 2000, rather than 200,000 (which is what it should be), and I didn't really want to generate 200,000 instructions for lists that are going to be mostly empty. Instead, I'm now initialising the lists with the required amount of elements, in some sort of sensible default state (i.e. 0 or ""), and then in the WASM `start` function, using the `array.init_data` or `array.init_elem` (for strings) functions, which svaes quite a lot of space in the generated WASM. Yay! 21 tests pass now :)˚GI've most recently rewritten the playlist view and the JSON layout for the music player.

(I did submit this project previously for Page but I do plan to continue to add features and such, including integrating additional projects)˚ the beginning of redoing ntwatch! originally, ntwatch was made for the athena initative as purely a macos socket overview. in this version, it will show only sockets that have associated packets coming from the en0 (wifi) interface, with statistics about both the sockets and packets. sort of like a combination of nettop and wireshark! so far, i haven't done any ui - only restructuring a lot of code, getting rid of a lot of stuff, adding a clean bubbletea command flow with tea.cmds, and extremely basic packet to process matching functionality. the socket table is created at the beginning of runtime and at every tick, and there's a goroutine that listens for packets - when a packet is recieved, another goroutine checks if there's an associated socket, and if there isn't, it refrshes the socket table and attempts to match again. obviously there's a huge bug here, as a lot of packets will never have matching sockets (stale packets), but it's a good start. yay!cAdded a logo, added a colored chance display, and made the button color change based on the chance.}Initialized project and added basic features. going to /tmdb/:id now shows info about the movie, including its letterboxd id.πDuring this devlog, I have created the Games (/games) page with its categorization functionality based on categories and difficulties.

Since this is supposed to be a tower, I made it draw the sides of the building at the horizontal edges of the level, and draw a solid dark color above and below it, which is supposed to be the outside of the building / other floors of the tower.

Some list blocks take more arguments than the equivalent(ish) variable blocks, which was causing confusion in the SSA optimisation - these are now ignored and things work as expected.

When new SSA variables were created, they were created with a dummy initial value of `false`. This was artificially inflating their type to include `Boolean`, which was causing problems; new SSA variables are now created with an empty type, as expected.

During an in-game paralysis episode, the player has to manually control their breathing by holding and releasing the spacebar at a slow, steady pace. You have to feel the rhythm and stay calm while everything else in the scene is trying to distract or scare you. If the player rushes their breathing, hesitates for too long, or falls out of sync, the system treats it as panic, and the episode ends badly (i.e. monster jumpscare). The goal is to turn something automatic into something tense and deliberate, forcing the player to stay composed under pressure.

Added some basic structure, buttons, css, etc. Continue to learn astro and fixing the holy grail layout, it aint working :<Dtest calendar (no actual functionality but I can navigate around it)_I am working on my first ever Flutter framework project. And I'm trying to learn with this too.Window management complete!≤Got started on it, used VSCode to write the code. I worked mainly on the index.html and style.css. I used GitHub Desktop to sync it to GitHub. I also deployed a GitHub.io website˚,I added:
- Basic functionality to the main menu and the actual DAW itself.
- You can make a session (like a project/song) and navigate around the basic interface.
- No recording or actual sound interface yet, it's just a basic UI that I got going here.
- Sessions don't actually get stored anywhere, thinking of making a file format for that, so that you can load them in that would be neat.
- You can change basic project settings, but buffer length currently does nothing.
- Exit option works too, it just quits the program (what else would it do).˚I‚Äôm Shlok Vaidya, also known as @sentry, from India. I recently decided to build my portfolio website, and yes‚ÄîI chose Next.js 16, even after the widely discussed security breach. Since my site doesn‚Äôt handle sensitive user data, I felt comfortable moving forward with it and focusing on learning and building rather than worrying unnecessarily.

I started off with a basic template and chose Tailwind CSS for styling because of how flexible and efficient it is for UI/UX design. To speed things up and keep the design clean, I used pre-made UI components from shadcn/ui and Aceternity UI, along with a few other components like the globe component from GitHub.

The page also pulls in live data using the Hackatime, Spotify, and GitHub APIs, just to show what I‚Äôm building, listening to, and coding in real time. It‚Äôs a small touch, but it makes the site feel a bit more alive.

And finally the colors well i choose the most subtle and aesthetic color - beige (light mode) 
and light orangish shade along with black (dark mode)LDraggable test window has been added, now I'll add opening and closing apps.Ship!!˚EI built an RSS feed for my blog! This allows my posts to be seen on other platforms, so people wanting to read my posts don't have to check my blog for new posts when there aren't any. I also built an auto-save system on my admin panel for when I'm writing, which made me work very hard to sync state across the database, server, and client (my state hooks were causing issues with how I had them set up). I also added some other things, like the ability to download posts as .md files, improving the viewer for posts, sorting posts by published date, and improving error handling.#bulding a mp3 player like persona 3#bulding a mp3 player like persona 3672There's now beautiful liquid glass on the top bar.˚/Made VSCode project for the thing (Empty as of now because I don't have the components to make anything and I spent way too long messing around with wakatime trying to figure stuff out)

These include exponents that were evaluated left to right, factorials that weren't even detected, negative signs having precedence over exponents for some reason (e.g., -3^2 -> (-3)^2 -> 9 instead of -9) and so on. In the screenshot you can see some test cases it now successfully passes.˚9After spending almost an hour on reading RP2040 datasheet and figuring out the basics, I finally completed the following parts for my devboard:

Woohoo!! 

In Godot:
Made the project, player scene, and basic physics. 

In Garageband:
The VAST majority of the time here was spent working on the second song! I made the intro section, pre drop 1, buildup, drop, transition to pre-drop 2, and the buildup to drop 2! I kinda want to add voicelines (The Master styled) but I have no idea how I'm supposed to pull that off üò≠ 

Enjoy ts little snippet of the song!•I just started with the project, and made the first basics which is just the random number making part! It does not yet have you say between which numbers though....èFor some reason, I am unable to get a minimal working version of this. I am trying to fix the search thingy issue. See the output below the box˚˜I got raylib working with my shader, including the uniforms and texture. Now that that's done, main.c will remain mostly unchanged! In the shader, I spent a lot of time implementing Rain World's heavy rain effect (which as you can see is a big inspiration) but after finishing it I thought it didn't look very good. Instead, I've added a simpler rain effect and spent ~1 and a half hours just getting the randomness working. (Believe it or not, doing randomness without a random library is pretty hard.)˚UOKAYYY SO this was kinda a long thing and I did design this part of the system well most people would just add a row to the intermediary database to allow a new user to access a project but i went one step ahead and made my workflow little more stable. so firstly i check if the user trying to perform the operation is the owner of the project or not cuz i have a created_by column which it checks with and then i go on to check if the email id the user is trying to add is valid and does it exist or not and after all this there is also a function to get the uuid from the email cuz i used uuid in the table instead of email but now that i think back i should have given email i could have prevented one more less read hmm its a good thing to think about\. i mean no what if the user changes his email then what the system would lose its redundancy idk what it means but i think its this but ukwim and im yet to integrate it into the main api but ive written the contorller function the service function and the modal function just need to test it from the controller and if it works ill api it and integrate it into my frontend thats my next 2-3 hour plan but below is the list of files i created or like i designed and the result of running test function with sample values. ALSO i did a small code refactoring moving and structuring file  s to where they belongÎok i kinda just changed the layout a little bit (moved the bar to the top) and also changed the logo to be less bad.
i added error handling so that the app doesn't just break permanently every time there's a 404 error, so that's good.•Added the initial code to start bootstrapping the project:
- Hello World setup to make sure build system works
- Started scaffolding setup for scanning input files´I added mail and PostgreSQL implementations to the infrastructure. I will create registration and login controllers and add JWT token implementation to the infrastructure.3Coded the bird a bit more and the main gameplay too˚)So i figured out shit 

what was broken:

- Resizing window broke header
- Did not have box sizing set (which broke lots of things)

And then i added/fixed some other things including:

- better homepage (still a bit broken but its an easy fix)
- Cleaned things in general css html stuff5bing bang boop oh wow and ratatui is already importedTi clicked the mouse a few times and hit some letters and now im stuck in devlog hellî- Uploaded the demonstration model to Printables
- Fixed and recompiled the firmware cuz I just realized it didn't match the schematic.......(AHHHH˚˛ The time for this devlog is a bit long because I am not good at C++ or embedded.

added Loading animation¯Hello world! I haven't started this project yet, but I have done a little research. It's gonna be built with OpenGL as the primary rendering; I don't need anything on the scale of Vulkan. Here's a hello triangle that I'm using as my starting point.˚ØOk so apparently time is counted since the 15th of December, not from when you sign up to flavortown - so I've got 17 hours to devlog for. Sorry 'bout that. I have so much to say that it ends up going over the character limit, so I'll have to be quite concise.

So, a summary of what I've been working on in the last 5 days:
- variable type analysis has been rewritten to be less buggy and more maintainable - the main difference is that, rather than each step being responsible for writing any variable changes to the outer scope at the end, the outer step is responsible for this (this is inspired by the idea of 'phi nodes' in tradition SSA optimisations, which I've only recently become aware of). This makes life a lot easier, as steps don't need to keep track of multiple different states - they just focus on themselves, and when an inner step (in a loop or if/else block, for example) needs optimised, it can compare the state of the inner step to its own state, and react accordingly.
- I've taken some of turbowarp's (another scratch mod, that compiles scratch projects to javascript)'s  integration tests so I can do more automated tracking of feature parity with upstream. At the time of writing, ~18% of eligible tests pass, which isn't bad.
- This highlighted a lot of project loading issues which are now fixed, including that sb2 files (from projects created using Scratch 2) couldn't be loaded as they were never converted to sb3s. There are still a couple more bits and bobs which need ironing out, but they seem to be mostly quite obscure things (like having a null variable ID.... why does scratch allow that?!)
- A lot of housekeeping to do with dependencies and CI
- Variables are now generated with their initial values intact
- Most list operations are now supported, using wasm GC arrays for now.
- And some other small fixes.

Wow, that's quite a lot!

Basically, this just turns the list of tokens created by the Lexer into a Syntax Tree. It uses a set of grammar rules to handle stuff like operator precedence (a.k.a. order of operations in the math world) and will throw errors when necessary. Internally, it does this via Recursive Descent Parsing, which, contrary to its name, starts at the lowest precedence expression and recursively walks up to expressions with higher and higher precedence. Now, most of the interpreter stuff is complete and I just need to implement the state machine (to hold variables), built in constants and functions, evaluation of this syntax tree, and all the actual CAS stuffyeah i don't know D:I made a HACKPAD Case:)üi made the readme.md file!!!!!! it has a lot of styling so that's what took me so long :P

- Decided to use Astro to make my website (BTW im a programing noob).
- Fell in love with Astro! I had never had this feeling its so good finally understanding how everything works.
- Started getting the hang of actually programing.
- Worked on the Header and its basically done. and it has a nav and a clean look and its fixed in place
- Made a simple footer and its good enough for now.
- Working on the body with a css grid to get all the "Cards" in the right place which only now I'm almost getting it working.…I drew a bit of the player,a bit of the first boss and the first enemy.

Next up is probably parsing and adding a Syntax Tree, which could definitely take a while.BCreating my first opengl Project. Currently Learning about Opengl.˚%I haven't had a chance to work on my emulator for about 3 months (since SoM finished), so im hoping to make progress towards actually finishing this emulator over the winter holidays (you can't really ever finish an emulator though - you can always improve the accuracy).
\n

What im hoping to get done:
 - physical controller support
 - analog/dualshock controller emulation
 - improving the accuracy of the CDROM drive
 - FMV decoding (MDEC)
 - CD-XA audio
 - memory cards (maybe - there super painful to emulate because of timing quirks))This is my first time making a key charm![I'm working on setting up the nav bar, and I created a CSS piano that looks cool for input.˚%Perhaps the most barebones lexer ever made. Currently it only supports defining variables and settings their value to a number. Will be heavily expanded on in the future, with operators like +-*/, proper error handling, functions, parentheses, and everything you'd expect in a lexer for a CAS.˚Ómade a basic textual app and its proper input fields with minimal css, then i added the master password and vault logic, so now to add a password, you use your master password, which has a vault and is stored with an salt in the home directory. it uses cryptography for the encryptions and decryption! need to add the meme integration and make the other passwords more encrypted. currently i have loading meme commented, since it just slows the current flow, but will add meme integration soon.N/ACreated the CSS and Html filesbCreated the idea page, where you can edit or use the tools in the sidebar (frontend only till now)˚xI created most of the admin panel to manage blog posts, on both the frontend and backend. I had some challenges, mainly with sorting out how to build the PATCH requests to send as little data as possible (as I commonly write things on low data, and I want this to be practical for me to use). The end result turned out quite well, and I even implemented proper error handling!˚
For a project like this we first need to learn! The sh1mmer writeup and code is the main source here, but shimboot was also quite helpful. I've narrowed down the steps to take to make a bootable shim, and I just have to write the code to do it, and then the payload!WI've made a LOGO for my Chatbot. I wanted it to be minimalistic yet great to look at...˚∞Refactored code so TypeScript is happy, data is stored properly, and everything works smoothly. Also made a new UI that lists the details of each description with a new option menu to edit and delete the subscription. The site currently only supports frontend localStorage data storage but other than that everything is coming together. Also fixed some bugs and updated styling for the multipage modal for adding a new subscription.˚¡i know this probably looks really really stupid in this state, but i've added an extra engine for the minigame (it takes a while theres so many files you gotta add and basic functions to implement) and implemented the very basics of all the cues needed in molecano, including the
- slower keep the beat cue
- faster keep the beat cue
- copies of the ones above, but you have to press B instead of A
i probably look like im insane right now, but it WILL resemble this -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUPxxyBLWro soon. im gonna be making the sprites next and polishing stuff up (and i cant track making sprites or editing animations because no lapse yet üíî but we do this FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAMEE):Added documentation and messed around with jekyll too muchWJust added apple foundation model framework for device which supports app intelligence!WipidkTestú- Added a socket for Arduino Micro power supply

Got too many hours to log
1. Fixed Hackatime for Fusiong 360 because it was not compatible with the latest version (took me 2 hours!! AHHHH)
 - Remember to install requests and chardet in Fusion 360 directly (in the Add-in folder)
 - Change main.py to the same name as the .manifest file
 - Directly indicate the path to the pip library installed
2. Setting up Hackatime for Kicad (30 minutes, much faster than Fusion 360)

I tested this websocket stuff on a bunch of different devices, and I was super happy with the latency.

^ should have a cool little box around the text if flavortown lets me
changelog:
+ i made the theme page!
+ i made the ruby theme (beta; unfinished)!ÙJust added a build version for development, when click Run in xcode, it generate a new build number and build date automatically. though it's for developent, it can still be useful when user got a bug and   dev can check and fix it more easily.Ûmade a example website using rocket (crazy aah hours reading documentation sob) the link od the repo is in the demo link , dont forget to get ur client id and client secret if u wanna try it, nest is apparently down so i cant rly host this sobJjust added a graph of AI usage and the Add user button is finally working!˚õOkay So I continued what i was doing mainly worked on the project settings page so I needed to allow people to update their project and add multiple to the project as well so to do this i first created a modal which pops up when the button is clicked this was fairly simple and i used AI to do this cuz im bad at UI stuff so yea but i added the functionality to the thing like calling the right apis but thats just a place holder function for now while I make the apis. I also started the api's wrote a framework on how the api should work and then i wrote the postgres query for it and now im figuring to run it without adding it as an api obv so that i can test it./Init

This was mostly backend work, as I wanted a lightweight auth system (it just uses an environment variable for the password).
It also included database work to add things like a "published" field to the schema (to allow me to hide blog posts without deleting them), as well as hooking the blog up to an actual PostgreSQL database (running on my Raspberry Pi for development).testing one two three.work on the demo app to show off team switcher#added a new theme section :shocked:$<a href="https://github.com">asa</a>epic dings :DDDDY(scrapped) added theming menu

You can't even boot the image after it modifies the fs once.2added home address hiding! you will be safe now :3˚…I built the foundations of my blog (and its associated database), a footer, an about page that talks about me and things that I like, and a widget that integrates with another previous project of mine (called Universal Status)! The ongoing Nest outage has made it a bit harder for me to do this, as I typically use Nest PostgreSQL while developing, and Universal Status is hosted there. I got around the latter issue by running a local instance of Universal Status and pointing the site there, and the former issue by editing my function to temporarily use placeholder data (in the same schema the database will follow). This one was quite fun to work on, and I'm planning some very cool things with widgets soon!placeholder∞Currently I've been working on the EXT4 Driver, one function at a time. Im still working on the CreateDir function, but here is the FindDir (Find in Directory) function I made.:3óAdded a theme selector and radius selector to customize your student appearance.

I know, this is crazy.
What I changed:
+ instead of changing styles (ew disgusting almost 30+ lines) i just use css classes! (and made a couple of functions to help w/ that!)
+ i stopped nesting if statements ("disgusting formatting" -everyone)
+ stopped using "var" (stupid me thought it was another language, whoops!)
+ split settings sync to UI and actual settings :D

that's it!!!!!!! one heck of an update :3
oh yeah and it deletes textContent when it's supposed to be invisible!!!!!!!!!!!!! because why nottttttttttt˚\Working on a user management dashboard and then also figuring out how we can connect Slack to users. It's actually getting annoying now because for some reason the DB is able to pick it up in the admin dashboard, their Slack ID, but it's not able to pick it up in the user-facing UI. It's something to do with permissions that I have to figure out.©Added Screenshare Mode: You can replace sensitive information blurring with secure, black boxes! Blurring can be easily unblurred, so this might help HC employees! (/hj)=Set up a basic CLI using NodeJS/NPM and set up authentication˚TTo summarize the work I've put in until now (more than 1h 31m, of course), I have:
- Basic 3D shapes rendering
- Core of an Entity-Component System (ECS)
- Textures for 3D objects
- Specular reflections with specular maps

I'm trying to recreate Unity as much as possible, starting with the rendering system. I think soon I'll move on to scripting and then the UI. I still have a lot of things left in the component side so I might just work on that for a while, too. We'll see. This is going to be a massive project so I'm not too worried about spending too much time on a certain element.I made a projectWAdded container limits per users, IP based rate limiting, and some basic admin tooling.!Is it a bird? No, it's a dinosaur2Added user/authentication system using email otps!NI made it so that containers are stored in a postgres database, using knex.js.iso i made some functions to interact with HCA, bc writing the urls by hand will make me do silly mistakes.eee˚õOkay, so basically I spent the last hour-ish setting up a lot of the code. This included a lot of vibe coding on AMP, but mainly was setting up that server and making sure that everything is operational. So it definitely spent more than an hour in that time, but like obviously it's Hackatime. Okay, well here's a photo of making sure that the Inventive database works and making sure the UI looks professional.vWorked on revamping the UI to have a rounder, cleaner more modern look and move away from the "shadcn" aesthetic more.ãThe project is completed, applying the coded physics to the ball, which can move in different direction depending on the user's mouse input˚Hgot started on the site and built the foundations of my project list, home page, and "accounts" page. also included making a header and figuring out some fairly complex things, like tailwind css gradient text!
a lot of this work was getting started, and i am planning on starting the blog and doing a bunch of refinements soon."I can now draw lines on the canvas˚«added a cool banner to the top!!

You can also move between different pages of the modal and customize the subscription (the modal doesn't do anyhting yet). Also updated icons, added new subscription services, added a user nav dropdown (that doesn't work), and updated styling.üGot the basic command controller set up as well as a database intermediary to prevent copious database calls (pretty barebones and will be expanded soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è)3I designed the Schematic and PCB of the my macropadasaI got a window up and running!:cSome random image of pastryFirst Devlog!˚eI created a basic UI and backend using html, css, and javascript.

I set up basic deployment and Next.js dependencies for the project and added basic frontend UI with icons, cards, navigation, and text for the subscriptions tab.˚!I implemented project card sections in Astro that provide a quick and easy way for me to add cards as demoed in the screenshot. All the content of the cards is spelled out in the front matter of each project's mdx file. This is a new layout, and I need to plan further on what it will look like (besides writing detailed pages for every project of mine). The colors are a bit too low-contrast right now and are very monotone - which I'll improve sometime soon.

This probably did *not* necessitate 1h 33m of work, but frontend dev can be slow.LI designed the UI of the website, I will now get to the logic of the website$Added main() and custom number input˚âit has been a hot minute since i've used svelte/any web development at all (literally almost a year üò≠) but ive gotten the hang of it again and made the start of the main page!!
