Whether you‚Äôre a student, developer, or just need a quick solution, Utility-Toolbox has everything you need, all in one spot.tA web browser made from scratch in Rust with a custom HTTP Client, HTML+CSS parser and renderer, and JS interpreter.˚‡A software + hardware protect made in PlatformIO. This will be a timer that helps you pace yourself during standardized tests. The timer takes the allotted time of a test(or section of a test) and the amount of questions to be answered during that time, and displays which question you should roughly be working on at any given moment. Helping the user make more informed decisions on how to best allot their time during tests. This timer will make it easer to go back and review harder questions by aiding in getting through all the questions within a target time. 

Of course there are many possible uses for this, with other tests and ACT/SAT practice being the most obvious. Because of this, and the fact that I couldn't find a good timer like this online I might make a digital version of the timer to increase accessibility.

My goals for this project:
- Learn about PlatformIO and C++
- Create a useful device to help with testing
- Meet requirements for the ACT/SAT
- Have fun˚OpenHistoricalMap has a lot of useful data for both teachers and students, however the current system is hard to use for school.

But instead of playing on the real world you play on the world of Stardew Valley!˚<This project is a high-RPM LEGO vacuum engine powered by household vacuum pressure and paired with a custom multi-speed gearbox. The engine speed is continuously monitored by an onboard control circuit, which automatically engages the clutch and shifts gears using servo actuators. Instead of manual shifting, the system uses predefined RPM thresholds to select the appropriate gear in real time, keeping the engine running smoothly and efficiently. The result is a closed-loop, automatic transmission system that maintains stable operation while the engine speed changes.£This is s humorous game that I have made.

Inspired by BeautifulSoup. Instead of parsing static HTML and using tags, it fully renders the page and the entire DOM (including JS/CSS & slop) using Playwright. Then, it uses semantics; i.e: avg font size versus larger font sizes, lines, gaps, spacing, hierachy/reading order; etc, to reconstruct the page into a clean JSON/Markdown format.
Currently, the options are either:

- BeautifulSoup; static only, messy.
- Playwright; lower level, manual.

- Rich Soup builds on Playwright to give the DX of BeautifalSoup but can render properly like Playwright.

Primarily intended for document-like pages; i.e: Microsoft Learn, whitepapers (PDF-like), Wiki-like sites. Best part is it uses the layout, not tags, and it's not static! It can extract from garbled DOMs with hundreds of divs and hydration from React and Astro islands and Tailwind, etc etc, perfectly fine.ãPassword Manager built in Python, saved the passwords encrypted on the device, has a master password and ability to export/import passwordsMy personal website˚ûProof of Learning is an open-source platform that helps learners track real learning progress based on understanding and evidence - not time spent, streaks, or checklists.

NOTE (IMPORTANT): The Demo button takes you to the download. The zip file contains both the source code and exe (located inside the LSIM dir) the source code is needed to build games because I didn't make a dll for v1.0. Also, you may experience and error when loading the engine. I can't remember exactly but I think it says something about stdlibc.

A handmade 4x4 RC car built using DC gear motors, PVC pipe chassis, and recycled materials.
# 4x4 Powered Handmade RC Car

This is a handmade 4x4 RC car built using DC gear motors, a PVC pipe base, and recycled materials.

## Features
- 4x4 drive using four DC gear motors
- PVC pipe used as the main chassis
- Separate motor mounting for stability
- 7-channel RC receiver support
- Can add horn (buzzer) and headlights (LED)

## Chassis Design
The base is made from a normal round PVC pipe.
The pipe was cut lengthwise, flattened using heat, and reinforced to create a strong flat chassis.
Motor mounts are attached directly to the PVC structure.

## Power
- Battery mounted at center for balance
- Simple wired motor control

## Status
- Body not installed yet
- Electronics working

The term Face Witch has come to be used in reference to an Embedded Witch. The Face Witch is built using a Raspberry Pi 4. You might say, "What can this witch do?" She may not be able to cast spells like a conventional witch, however, when you provide her with a picture of a face, she retains that memories based upon the information provided to her by the user.Tamagotchi app for Linux˚ŸMiniMaxing is a chess AI platform where instead of playing against other players and moving yourself, you code an AI bot and challenge other player's AI. The inital project will have an optimized minimax algorithm in the backend with heuristics and alpha-beta pruning, and the player's objective is to make this algorithm as good as possible by writing the point evaluator. In minimax it requires giving a number to each game state and then backtracking. In some games this is easy, like tic-tac-toe where the possibilities are small and you can just search until the winning state. But in chess since this is exponential growth, that would be too inefficient. So you have to assign point values to intermediate states. But how do you assign points? Chess isn't just about raw point values of pieces and capturing them, position matters. That is the players job, given a set number of rules, they can write those rules in python such that they return a boolean, and give them a weight.6This is a website and identity provider for my homelab˚*This project is a simple Flappy Bird game built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The game runs directly in the browser and does not require any external libraries or frameworks. The player controls a bird that falls continuously due to gravity. Clicking anywhere on the page makes the bird jump upward. The goal of the game is to pass through the gaps between obstacles without hitting them. The score increases every time the bird successfully passes an obstacle. The game ends when the bird hits an obstacle or touches the top or bottom of the game area. After game over, the score is displayed and the game automatically restarts. The game is designed to be played using the mouse only. To play the game, open the index.html file in any modern web browser and start clicking to keep the bird flying.§Im creating the mickeymouse clubhouse, with their characters.

Goal of this project is to create a way for scientists and stuff to study marine environments while using a robot that mimics fish behavior to minimize impact. I saw MIT do this but they used purely ultrasonic communication meaning that the people controlling this had to be underwater and close to the robot anyways which kind of seems like it defeats the purpose so this hybrid structure takes advantage of easy data transfer in the air to allow for people to control the fish robot from a distance rather then have to be near it and it essentially just becoming a glorified RC fishßRevamped version of hacklyn.city/oskar; easier way to view Hackatime hours for projects submitted to YSWS programs.
